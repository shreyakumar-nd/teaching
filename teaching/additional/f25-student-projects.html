              <p>Our project focused on students' well being during Covid. We analyzed two sets of data comparing students in the US and in India. We looked at how major factors such as sleep, screen time, fitness, and mental health contributed to students' overall well being. Our findings suggest that sleep is very important to mental health (particularly for men), elevated screen time levels can be harmful, and that physical fitness is important to living a healthy life.

              <h6>crime</h6>
              <p>Our topic is about the relationship between the weather in U.S. cities and the number of crimes that are committed. We used weather data and crime data from the three biggest cities in the U.S.: Chicago, New York City, and Los Angeles. The key aspects we are visualizing are the trends of violent and nonviolent crimes in each city, the total amount of crime, and the frequency depending on the conditions. One of the biggest insights we noticed was that there was no consistent result, and all the cities had different correlations based on the weather. Even when putting all three cities together in the same visualization, there wasn't a strong enough result that would indicate correlation one way or another.

              <h6>crime</h6>
              <p>Our project explores the spatial and contextual relationship between crime and parks in Chicago using publicly available city crime data from the past year. Through visualizations, the project shows where crimes occur across the city, how they overlap with park locations, the distribution of park types, and patterns by crime type, time of day, and location. Major insights show that crime is not evenly distributed, and clusters heavily on the South and West sides of Chicago, while the North sides and lakefront areas experience lower crime and higher park density. Although many crimes occur near parks, our analysis suggests that this is driven more by population density, foot traffic, and common park amenities, rather than parks causing crimes themselves. Property-related crimes dominate overall crime, and crime peaks during midday and early evening hours when public activity is the highest. Overall, our project highlights how neighborhood characteristics, access to green space, and urban activity patterns together shape crime distribution in Chicago.

              <p>The project Sean and I worked on involved looking at data on disabilities and school health policies within the United States across the different states of the country. The reason why Sean and I decided to look focus on disabilities and health education across the United States was to understand how prevalent different types of disabilities were across the United States, understand what health education and health policies are emphasized in different schools across the country, and how disabilities and health education are related. The disability and health education data used in the project was sourced as CSV files from data.gov website, where they were cleaned to focus on the year 2022 as it was the only year available for the health policy data, which we matched the disability data to. The project's visualizations help to identify a mix of disability-related information and health policy-related information, such as distribution of disabilities across demographics and location, along with distribution of health policies taught overall. Some of the major insights the project on disability and health education found involve: 1) specific regions and areas with high prevalence of disability, such as the Human and Health Services Region 4, need more government support for teaching about and caring for people in need with disabilities, 2) some states need more data collection practices in terms of disability information and health policy information to further detail how to help and educate on disabilities along with knowing what exactly is needed or not needed, and 3) some related school health policy programs for after school and youth development need more emphasis for helping students with disabilities find ways of working through their disabilities for when they eventually become adults.

              <p>This project looks at how crime rates and education outcomes vary across Chicago neighborhoods using data from the City of Chicago Open Data Portal. We combined crime data with Chicago Public Schools data to compare crime levels by community area with education measures like graduation rates. The visualizations show clear differences between neighborhoods, with areas that have higher crime often showing lower graduation rates. Overall, the project highlights how community conditions and education outcomes are connected across the city.

              <h6>financial, international, environmental </h6>
              <p>Our project analyzes trends in water consumption data, combining it with other environmental and financial factors to see how water usage is affected by these factors. The data sources we pulled included economic and environmental information, such as GDP, CO2 emissions, rainfall amounts, and extreme weather events.

Some aspects we visualized were total water consumption by country and year, per capita water consumption by country and year, industrial water consumption percentage by country and year, and agricultural water consumption percentage by country and year, among others.

The major insights we discovered from this project is that there is no direct trend or correlation between water consumption, country, and year (other than the fact that larger countries consume more water total). Additionally, there seemed to be no general trends between environmental factors (i.e. CO2 emissions, extreme weather events, etc.) and water usage amounts - water usage was very randomized over the years. The same can be said for water usage amounts and economic factors (i.e. GDP), which showed no general trend or tendency towards higher or lower values.

              <p>Our project, "Does money buy happiness?" explores the correlation between quality of life and cost of living. We extracted data from two different sources: Data source 1 includes data for each county in the US and certain factors that we then used to quantify a quality of live value, and Data source 2 includes quality of life factors such as health, rights, and safety on an international/country scale. We have made seven visualizations and many of them include the comparison between weighted and unweighted quality of life values.

              <p>Our topic had to do with statistics relating to students and how a variety of social and personal factors influence their academic performance. This dataset from kaggle.com provides structured information on students’ academic performance and the demographic, behavioral, familial, and institutional factors that influence achievement. We visualized the impact of parental involvement and academic level on testing. Another goal was to determine how factors like attendance, tutoring session, hours of studying, and household proximity correlated to exam score.  We visualized how parental involvement and academic level influence test performance, and we also looked at how attendance, tutoring sessions, study hours, and household proximity correlate with exam scores. Overall, we found that close proximity—and the resulting higher class attendance—positively influences academic outcomes. Teacher quality and institutional type also proved to be contributors to student performance. Additionally, increased parental involvement, frequent tutoring sessions, and extended hours of studying were all associated with higher exam scores.

              <p>Our topic focuses on analyzing crime from the reported crime stats of both Chicago and New York, which are both major cities in the US. All the data sources involved come from the open city data and are the city crime reports. This created some challenges because different cities release different things, so we compared what was applicable. This led to visualizations comparing the crime profile between New York and Chicago in a certain year, Chicago before and after COVID, and the percentages that a certain crime type makes up of the total crime type. This led to some major insights. One insight was that different cities have vastly different crime profiles and vary with the prevalence of a specific type of crime. Another was that crime overall was not affected by short-term events such as COVID, but specific types of crimes might have been influenced. An additional major insight was that the crimes in a city can often be dominated by a specific type of crime, which is essential when trying to increase public safety.

              <p>This project explores the digital divide by comparing public internet access and digital infrastructure in New York City and South Bend, two cities with very different scales and resources. Using open data from NYC Open Data and the City of South Bend, I visualized the locations and totals of public Wi-Fi hotspots, public computer centers, neighborhood-level access patterns, and community complaints over time. The visualizations include interactive maps, choropleths, and summary charts that highlight where digital resources are concentrated and where gaps exist. One major insight from the project is that access to public Wi-Fi and computer resources is highly uneven within each city, not just between them, with certain neighborhoods and districts consistently underserved. These patterns suggest that digital inequality is a local, neighborhood-level issue and that targeted infrastructure investments could significantly improve access.

              <p>In this project, we wanted to demonstrate the economic effects of climate change. We used data sources on carbon emissions in the world and US to show how carbon emissions have been increasing. We also used data sources showing rising temperatures to show how those carbon emissions have led to higher temperatures. We then found our ultimate conclusions with data sources showing costs and number of billion dollar disasters, which showed the true economic impact of climate change. We ultimately found that the rise in temperature is taking an enormous financial toll on America, and is taking away from money that America could be using to fund other projects. This is not an issue that only America faces, but we specified in the economic toll on America.

              <p>This project analyzes global air quality and its socioeconomic and health correlates using publicly available data from the WHO Global Air Quality Database, OpenAQ, the World Bank, and the WHO Global Health Observatory. We visualize trends in PM2.5 pollution over time, differences across income levels, relationships between pollution and GDP or urbanization, and health outcomes such as respiratory deaths, asthma rates, and life expectancy. The visualizations reveal strong evidence of environmental inequality, with lower income countries facing higher pollution and greater health burdens. We also find that economic development alone does not ensure cleaner air and that rapid urbanization is often linked to worse air quality. Overall, the project demonstrates how air quality, public health, and economic development are closely connected and provides insights that can inform policy and environmental action.

              <p>Our topic is the 9 leading causes of death in both the United States and Mexico. We also compared this information with mental health diseases with the result of recent events. All of our data was collected by public health databases through CSV format. Some of the aspects we visualized were the comparisons of each of the 9 causes of death with both countries and had some of just the United States. The biggest insight we had was the sheer number of deaths the United States had over Mexico in each category, but we eventually chalked this up to logic because of the population difference between the two.

              <p>Marriage has been an important part of all cultures throughout history. However, marriage trends has changed throughout the years, and comparing marriage between certain groups allows us to better understand the bigger picture of the nation's relationship with marriage. Through scatter, bar, and line graphs, we plotted different arrays of marriage percentages and divorce percentages against education, income, ethnicity, and gender. We found that in all demographics, marriages are decreasing and divorce is increasing, however the rate of these changes vary depending on the demographic.

              <p>This project focuses on threats to endangered species in the top twelve most populated U.S. states. To identify the most influential threats to endangered species, we analyzed data pertaining to different types of pollution that likely affect these species and their habitats. We used data on air quality, landfills, methane emissions, pollutant waste discharge, toxic waste discharge, and tree loss. By examining and comparing this data with the amount of endangered species in each of these states, we found that each state has a different factor or combination of factors that contribute to the amount of endangered species. For example, endangered species in California and Texas are most threatened by tree loss, air quality, methane emissions, and landfills. Meanwhile, endangered species in New Jersey are most affected by total pollutant discharge from major facilities and endangered species in Ohio. Overall, we hope that these data visualizations and insights will help policy makers to better combat the continued endangerment of species in specific state.

              <p>The project is comparing institutional environment versus individual behavior in global philanthropy. We aim to determine how national factors such as sociocultural environment and tax incentives correspond with individual giving behavior. This project uses two global datasets to explore institutional factors, such as governance, political stability, and support for civil society, and how these relate to actual philanthropic behavior by individuals. The first dataset, the Global Philanthropy Environment Index, scores countries based on how supportive their environment is for philanthropy. The second dataset, the CAF World Giving Index, measures individual giving behavior through metrics like donating money, volunteering, and helping strangers. By comparing these, our project investigates whether strong institutional environments lead to more generosity, or if individual behavior is independent of system-level support.

              <p>This project studies death trends in the United States using CDC data on leading causes of death, drug overdoses, and suicide. We compare causes like heart disease and cancer with overdose and suicide deaths to see how patterns have changed over time. The visualizations show that while traditional causes remain the most common overall, drug overdose deaths have increased sharply since the early 2000s, mainly driven by opioids, especially synthetic opioids. The data also shows clear differences by sex and age, with higher overdose and suicide rates among males and middle-aged adults. A state-level example from Connecticut shows similar rising trends followed by recent changes. Overall, the project highlights how drug overdoses have become a major and growing public health issue in the U.S., alongside persistent suicide risks.

Our data source is 3 seperate CSV files; one is gas car mpg, one is electric car mpg, and the last one is gas car emissions. We visualized the gas mileage for gas cars and converted gas mileage for electric cars along with a weighted scatter plot visualizing emissions, weight of car, and footprint. We have learned that newer cars have gotten more fuel efficient over the years, but they're also heavier and produce more emissions. We've also learned that EVs are considerably more fuel efficient overall compared to gas cars.

              <p>This project explores air quality across the United States to understand how pollution affects different regions and how it has changed over time. Using real environmental data, we built a set of visualizations such as maps, charts, and graphs to reveal patterns in the Air Quality Index (AQI), industrial pollution, and long-term air quality trends. Our findings show a strong link between industrial activity and poorer air quality, clear improvements in AQI during the COVID-19 pandemic, and steady progress in reducing pollution since the 1990s. By presenting these insights in an interactive and visual format, the project makes complex environmental data more accessible and highlights how human activity and policy decisions directly shape the air we breathe.
