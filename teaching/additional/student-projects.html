        		<p>My project uses data from the 2019 MLB season to create visualizations. The first visualization allows the user to enter a threshold value for a statistic, and the program prints all players with a statistic value above/below the threshold value. The second statistic uses data from all players to display a possible correlation between two statistics. The final visualization takes two players as input from the user and compares them, creating a graph and printing out which stat each player leads in.  - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fAIQcn-ke7TgxxlHXKhber26SuChc-Wf/preview</p>

This project aims to provide insight into the question: can money buy support and/or success in the MLB? I focused on the MLB instead of other professional sports because there is no salary cap in baseball and thus, there is a broader range of payrolls and more important and interesting conclusions can be drawn from the data. By interacting with my visualizations, users can gain insight into the correlation between payrolls, attendance, and success in general and for specific teams and seasons. - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-X6T45LS69yeDMsxIdBrbrRiqS5g4EsZ/preview</p>

        		<p>While popular machine translation services like Google Translate provide exceptional translation between popular languages, they are often less fantastic at translating particular styles of writing. One example of this is in translating the rules text of Magic: The Gathering cards, where Google Translate frequently substitutes very important keywords with specific meaning within the game for synonyms. This project aims to train a Spanish-to-English machine translation model over the extensive set of professionally-translated Magic cards to yield more accurate automated translation, and compare the developed model to Google Translate. - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EEqvp3VoF7MLjG7QnoXdr5nEhU4diSYJ/preview</p>

My project uses data from multiple sources on food insecurity and demographics in North Carolina to create visualizations representing the relationship between the food insecurity rates in North Carolina and the number of grocery stores per county. From this data, I created three visualizations comparing different aspects of the data, including food insecurity vs. number of grocery stores, food insecurity vs. population, and a map showing the food insecurity rates.

        		<p>My project's original scope was to compare fast food restaurant density and poverty rate to see if there is a relationship between the two. Originally, I had only found data for fast food restaurant density by state, however, I eventually found it by county, which allowed me to expand the scope of my project. I also thought of some other interesting factors that may relate to the two original variables, so I included those as well. In the end, my project allows the user to choose between state or county data as well as choose between scatter, choropleth, and 3D scatter plots. Once the user selects these, they can then determine other elements of the graph, such as the x-axis, y-axis, color, etc. - https://drive.google.com/file/d/10aA9q5gU5qnImrk3yDk8HGoMhFxdsu2i/preview</p>

The game runs in real-time, makes use of animation and the visually-appealing “retro-style”, user interaction with the keyboard and mouse moves the Pac-man and controls the menu. There is four direction movement, utilizing the standard “Up, Down, Left, Right” scheme. The game includes multiple “behavior” modes. These include a “frightened” mode, a “random” mode, and a “chase” mode. The “frightened” mode resembles the mode in the standard Pac-man game where the game is flipped and the ghosts can be consumed by the Pac-man. In summary, this project is simply remaking pacman with 3 ghosts instead of 4.  - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Tz9gkHl3tJ0SlORX1EmmAjxhrmDWHHQH/preview</p>

Once that information is collected, I will use the Spoonacular API to find data of all available recipes that meet the criteria.

The dataset included information about Broadway shows by the week and specified information like the date of the end of the week, the show name, the theatre, the attendance for the week, the percent capacity, the gross for the week, and the % gross possible where applicable.  I changed the data in the CSV file to a DataFrame, and then manipulated the data that I wanted to use further from there.  Through a process that transferred the data into more understandable information, I display three visualizations to help theatre fans and interested users learn more about Broadway through the years.  After the user enters the year of their choice, they see a bar graph of weekly attendance for a show, a pie chart of types of shows in the year, and a bar graph of weekly gross for a show.  The user can change the show they are looking at with a drop down menu above each bar graph, and the options of shows differ depending on the year they entered at the beginning of the program.  - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w6MdtCEq5qr73joLKUacBOBigYZNjav8/preview</p>

It uses the data to create a multiple linear regression model that can be used to predict the win percentage of a team given a few data points. The linear regression model also shows how different statistics relate to a team's success. The data was used to find the best and worst teams for various statistics for the 2019-2020 season. The data was also used to create various visualizations that can be used to compared how various team statistics are related to each other. - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zm9bKKdZQyDnJvWM9aG9xSXKphHmGczQ/preview</p>

        		<p>For my final project in Intro to Engineering II, I created a program which simulates the process of natural selection. The code analyzes traits that are most crucial in survival against competitors. Initial creatures compete against each other for resources. Each creature has traits that hold the potential to mutate including size, speed, vision, passiveness, aggressiveness, and attack ratio. In addition, different traits equate to varying levels of energy consumption.  For example, the larger the size of the creature, the more energy required for movement. As the program runs, successful creatures reproduce, and unsuccessful creatures die off. The program demonstrates which traits are most important in the environment of the simulation and related survival.  - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SctYMCjh5XxWgfprbMcljBjeFR4EIcZf/preview</p>

        		<p>I took nfl fantasy football data from the years 2018 and 2019 for four fantasy/offensive positions. After putting the data into a dataframe (and also creating multiple new columns for additional player-selection criteria), I prompted the user via interact to select which criteria they prefer for selecting fantasy football players for their roster. They then are able to adjust the weights for each criterion, or how much emphasis they place on each one. Online fantasy sites have an option called "auto draft", where the computer uses a proven method to automatically select quality players. My goal was to give the user the power to compete with the computer and try to maximize their own team's total scoring and wins on their own. In short, I am manipulating and using the 2018 data to draw conclusions and best select player for the 2019 season. I then use data from 2019 to simulate a new season to test these criteria set for each player. At the end, the program shows us with visuals who wins in both raw scoring and total wins, an aspect most fantasy players (including the auto draft system) neglect when drafting. - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L_DPmW5eVmRc0BfoSV4spAw1Hz34Hq1J?usp=sharing</p>
