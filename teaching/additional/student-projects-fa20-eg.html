        		<p>My project uses data from the 2019 MLB season to create visualizations. The first visualization allows the user to enter a threshold value for a statistic, and the program prints all players with a statistic value above/below the threshold value. The second statistic uses data from all players to display a possible correlation between two statistics. The final visualization takes two players as input from the user and compares them, creating a graph and printing out which stat each player leads in.  - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fAIQcn-ke7TgxxlHXKhber26SuChc-Wf/preview</p>

        		<p>I took nfl fantasy football data from the years 2018 and 2019 for four fantasy/offensive positions. After putting the data into a dataframe (and also creating multiple new columns for additional player-selection criteria), I prompted the user via interact to select which criteria they prefer for selecting fantasy football players for their roster. They then are able to adjust the weights for each criterion, or how much emphasis they place on each one. Online fantasy sites have an option called "auto draft", where the computer uses a proven method to automatically select quality players. My goal was to give the user the power to compete with the computer and try to maximize their own team's total scoring and wins on their own. In short, I am manipulating and using the 2018 data to draw conclusions and best select player for the 2019 season. I then use data from 2019 to simulate a new season to test these criteria set for each player. At the end, the program shows us with visuals who wins in both raw scoring and total wins, an aspect most fantasy players (including the auto draft system) neglect when drafting. - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L_DPmW5eVmRc0BfoSV4spAw1Hz34Hq1J?usp=sharing</p>
