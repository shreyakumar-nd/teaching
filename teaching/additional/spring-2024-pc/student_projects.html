    <h1>Student Projects</h1>
    <p>The following is a listing of demos of student projects done in the Spring 2024 Principles of Computing course.
      The students found their choice of data source from resources online and decided how they want to examine, analyze and visualize the data.

              <p>For our project, we have made a website that contains information regarding electronic vehicles. We have made visualizations that will help the user choose EVs according to their requirements. It can also be used by policy-makers to identify the current state of the EV market, what features customers like etc. Electric vehicles are more popular in the United States, Europe and East Asia. The more expensive EVs tend to have the higher top speeds and acceleration.

              <p>In our project, we are analyzing Covid-19 data at not only the local Indiana scale, but expanding it to the United States and even global level. We used four different data sources, grabbing data from the World Health Organization, the  Indiana Government website, The Covid Tracking Project, and Our World in Data - Coronavirus Pandemic. We visualized how covid cases compared to the amount of deaths, how different countries were affected by covid, and even how Indiana compared to some of the national averages. It was clear that Indiana did not do as well as the rest of the country on average handling covid. Our data also shows that life expectancy for the United States was minimally altered, likely due to the older generations being affected most by covid and hence not affecting life expectancy.

              <p>Our topic for this project was to analyze race and its affect (or not) in general college admissions in the United States. There were two data sources used for this project. The first data source came from the National Center for Education Statistics, and it describes the total fall enrollment in degree-granting postsecondary institutions by race/ethnicity of student and state or jurisdiction. The 2015-2016 and 2020-2021 datasets were used. The second data source describes undergraduate admissions data, including individual level UG admissions data from 42 public institutions for incoming classes in the 2005-2007 period around the country.  Some aspects we are visualizing includes SAT, ACT, and GPA of each race, and percent breakdown of each race at postsecondary institution by state. One major insight from this project is that there may be a correlation between race and the result of admission, but it is not the sole factor in college. In other words, there are other aspects that are also just as or more important to college admissions than just race.

              <p>This website provides a comprehensive analysis of the frequency of arrests and crime incidents in Los Angeles from 2020 to present. The visualizations are constructed using two datasets from the Los Angeles Police Department Open Data Portal. The arrests dataset details over 280,000 arrests. The crime incident dataset contains over 932,000 crime victims. Crimes and arrests in Los Angeles are investigated in terms of area, age, gender, race, type, and year. Some major insights include what type of people are most likely to be victims for crimes or be arrested.

              <p>This website explores mental health statistics on a global and national level. The global data set has disorder prevalence from 1990 to 2019 for schizophrenia, depressive, anxiety, bipolar, and eating disorders. The national data set has suicide rate by demographic group from 1950 to 2018. The website visualizes the suicide rate in the US by age over time, the worldwide prevalence of depressive disorder overtime, and many other thought-provoking topics. We found that the older, white men have the highest suicide rates, and that Iran and New Zealand are a couple of the countries with the highest disorder rates.

Some major insights we saw from the project include California having more household owners of a college background of a college degree and higher, along with the majority of household owners from both states being white.

Major insights from my project include that Heart Disease was the biggest killer while suicide was least.

              <p>Our team has executed a deep analysis of obesity rates across the United States specifically, and beyond. We have spotlighted Indiana in order to better understand the community we have moved into since attending Notre Dame. We also explored social justice issues pertaining to obesity such as the likelihood of obesity within groups that live far from grocery stores and do not have access to cars. Lastly, we investigated the correlation between race and obesity. We hope that our conclusions jolt Americans awake to their physical state and what they could be doing better.

It is a very "global" study, as we analyze race, gender, and age and try to grasp insights from the data. Some major insights were: both men and women value intelligence a lot, women value the trait "funny" much more than men, women are more open to interracial dates.

              </h5>
              <h6>Joao Pedro Pilao</h6>
              <h6>social, financial, international</h6>
              <p>This project delves into the developmental trajectories of countries categorized within different income groups. Using data from diverse sources such as the World Factbook, it visualizes key economic, demographic, and environmental indicators across high-income, middle-income, and low-income nations. By examining metrics like GDP, electricity consumption, public debt, life expectancy, birth and death rates, and unemployment rates, the project aims to uncover insights into disparities and trends within and across income groups. The visualizations shed light on how economic status influences various aspects of development, offering valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders interested in global development dynamics.
