	  <div class="email">
	  <p><strong>Date:  Wed, 30 Mar 2005 15:27:33 -0500 (EST)</strong></p>
      <p>Subject:  Meeting Notice</p>
      <p>From:  Denise</p>
      <p>To:  crane-cs-l@mtu.edu</p>
      
      <p>Reminder:</p>
      <p>Meeting  12:30, Thursday 3/31/05, Rehki 114</p>
      
	  
	  </div>
      <p>The  team spends some time trying to “figure things out” about the  code, Matlab and the project in general:</p>
      <p>[Matlab-Code-Project  3-31.mp.3, 14 min.]</p>

      <p>There  is discussion on points of contention from their previous discussion  with Hank. The team asks themselves the following questions:</p>
      <p>Should  we be using structs or pass things in vectors as Hank had suggested  before?</p>
      <p>How  does input from the joystick come in? Input values, or vectors or  sine wave?</p>
      <p>
        <!-- We see the change in how structured and productive the internal team meetings are. The team members appear more focused than they have been in the past, and appear to be more aligned with their goals. -->
        What  are multiplexers and how is the code using them?</p>
      <p><BR>
          <BR>
      </p>
      <p>They  also revisit what Hank wants:</p>
      <p>[Client  Wants.mp3, 2 min.]</p>
      <p>The  team recaps part of the discussion with Hank about Inverse kinematics</p>
      <p>They  discuss that they just want command motor. And some discussion is  there towards the end about the fact that the sponsors are coming  sometime during exam week.</p>
      
	 <div class="transcript"> 
      <p> Justin: How  come Hank wants us to do those work vectors or whatever, in case we  want to recompile it back into C, what is the purpose?</p>
      <p>
        <!-- The team is discussing an important question about reasons for major strategy. -->
        Denise:  it took so much work to convert it from C to matlab just to convert  it back.</p>
      <p> Bob: Maybe  that is what the summer job was. That is why he wants us back next  summer.</p>
      <p> Denise: It  better pay very well if we are doing this</p>
      <p> (more  discussion on code variables)</p>
    </div> 
      <p>And  revise their responsibilities:</p>
      <p>[Team  Resp 3-31.mp3, 8 min.]</p>
      <p>The  team discusses what init does and what solution does. These are  different blocks of code.</p>
      <p>Solution  calculates the input swing, like the pre-init.</p>
      <p><BR>
      </p>
      <div class="transcript">
	  <p> Denise: I am  not leaving this building for at least 5 hours.</p>
      <p> Justin: So we  should be passing the structs as vectors? Why cant be pass the  structs?</p>
      <p> Bob: We cant.</p>
      <p> Denise: We  cant pass them because S function does not know what a struct is.</p>
      <p> Bob: We are  putting this code to this block and then that code to that block,how  do we know whether it will execute at the right time.</p>
      <p> Denise: we are  just putting it together and see if it will work.</p>
      <p> (more code  discussion)</p>
      <p> Justin: What  is the point of initializing this function?</p>
      <p> Denise: It is  not initializing them, it is just calling them, and it has a point  array which it takes by reference and changes that.</p>
      <p> (more code  discussion)</p>
      <p> Justin: Is  solution calling this? Or is solution the last thing on the list that  spits it out.</p>
      <p> Denise: Yes  solution calls it. Solution we are going to try and preserve.</p>
      <p> Justin: So  what is init doing.</p>
      <p> Denise: init  is just initializing value.</p>
      <p> Justin: So how  does solution affect swing angle.</p>
      <p> Denise:  Solution calls the value and updates the swing angle. Solution is the  function in CS which calls everything else.</p>
      <p> Justin: So  solution is what starts everything off.</p>
      <p> Denise: it  initializes the control stuff and the analog input </p>
      <p> Justin: so, It  is kind of like a pre-init. Before the init.</p>
      <p> Bob: when time  are we meeting next week?</p>
      <p> Denise: Do you  guys want to meet before meeting with Hank or after meeting with  Hank.</p>
      <p> (regular  banter)</p>
      <p> Denise:  Alright does everyone have enough stuff to do this weekend?</p>

</div>

      <p>You  can listen in as Denise “takes charge” of the team:</p>

      <p> Denise:
          <!-- Denise appears to be very comfortable about blatantly appearing as the leader. One can see become an authority figure, like Hank. -->
        Alright does everyone have enough stuff to do  this weekend?</p>
</div>

      <p>And  as they reflect on the project—this term and last:</p>
      <p>[Reflections  3-31.mp3, 8 min.]</p>
      <p>Discussing  if some of this was done last semester, they would have not had to do  so much of it.</p>
      <p><BR>
      </p>
<div class="transcript">    
	  <p> Bob:
          <!-- Bob recanting his experience from last semester, and comparing how pleased he was with the current team, and the progress that was being made. -->
        I wish you guys were on my team last semester, cause this  would have been done. Our partner was never coming to the meetings,  and Joann tried, but it took her time to understand the code, and was  concerned about getting it finished, but we would have many very long  meetings and we would just sit there.</p>

</div>
      <p>On  Thursday, but unrelated to the meeting, Dave responds to a request  from Denise:</p>

      
	 <div class="email"> 
	  <p><strong>Date:  Thu, 31 Mar 2005 15:35:29 -0500</strong></p>
      <p>From:  Dave Voelker</p>
      <p>To:&nbsp;  Denise</p>
      <p>Subject:  other stuff that is on my mind</p>

      <p>&gt;You  mentioned that you would not be at the Senior Design meetings  tomorrow or next Thursday, are &gt;there any topics you want us to  address? We will keep you posted of any important information. Is  &gt;there anything specific you want from our group for the end of  the semester? We would like to begin &gt;working on it soon if  possible.</p>

      <p>&gt;Denise</p>
      
      <p>Good  question.&nbsp; What other miseries can I impose on you?...&nbsp; I  think it would be nice to have a demo and code review with Hank and  me in attendance.&nbsp; Let's schedule something a little before the  end of the semester, so that you can make changes accordingly.&nbsp;  How about week 13?</p>
      
      <p>I'm  wondering how we can document your knowledge of the C code, so that  others can use it.&nbsp; Can you think about how to take your  internal knowledge, and that scary hand-drawn picture, and turn them  into something understandable to others?</p>
      
      <p>Dave</p>
      
</div>
      <p>After  the meeting Justin sends:</p>

      
	  <div class="email">

      <p>Subject:  The matlab model, woohoo</p>

      <p>Hey  all,</p>
      <p>I  got the matlab model attached, as well as the individual c files for  editing.&nbsp; Right now it does nothing, but looks pretty.&nbsp; I  figured for name consistency I'd throw in the c files, I'll get the  helper.h file done probably sometime on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Dave,  I made a screenshot so you can view the model without having matlab.</p>

      <p>Enjoy,</p>

      <p>setup.M  - creates a params vector with 96 items that needs to be included in  all s-functions defines.h - #define global values, reads in the  params[] and sets defined constants equal to their values.</p>
      <p>struct.h  - #defines used in converting stuctures to vectors, read for more  explination init.c - S-Function for intialization</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Could  we all meet at 11:45 to discuss our progress this weekend?</p>

      <p>To:  Crane Team &lt;crane-cs-l@mtu.edu&gt;</p>
      <p>Subject:  Not sure if I will make meeting...</p>
      
      <p>Team,</p>
      
      <p>My  car is currently not able to start, I have been having problems with  it recently. I am working on getting a ride to the meeting as we  speak. I will try and make the meeting. Not sure if you will get this  message before the meeting is over.</p>
      
      <p>Sorry</p>
      <p>-Bob</p>
	  
	  </div>
      <p>The  meeting with Hank begins with the CS team searching for definition of  some terms and what those terms ‘do’—deadman leads, how the  controller “jumps in the middle’ at about 7 minutes in, followed  by an explanation of encoders:</p>
      <p>[Defining  Terms &amp; Functions 4-5.mp3, 18 min.]</p>
      <p><BR>
      </p>

      <p>There  is a discussion about the parameters dead man vs dead man old and  corresponding modes control mode vs control mode old. They also  discuss with Hank that another parameter pedestal wont change but one  needs to have it in the code. They then move on to discuss an object  or struct for the ship parameters and values.
          <!-- The nature in which Hank inquires into the team's understanding this time, is far less in the nature of assessing them, and reflective of the greater amount of confidence he has in them at this point. He asks about the team's understanding here only to decide how far he needs to explain the concept to them, and not so much to judge their efforts. -->
        Hank asks if the team has examined where these  variables are used.</p>
      <p>Hank  then moves on to describe the role of encoders, in that encoders are  measuring the boom angle. He asks if this gets calculated somewhere  in the code.</p>
      <p>There  is more discussion about the parameters and values used in the code.  At one point in the discussion Hank comments that Denise knows this  code better than anyone.</p>
      <p>The  discussion moves on to other topics like how Inverse kin is called  according to where you want the ship to be based on the crane  position. Hank explains how joystick and nominal crane position work  together. They talk about a crane limited version of inv kin, like a  command for where u want the crane to be. Hank demonstrates how an  encoder works, and explains what the dead man is.</p>
      <p><BR>
      </p>
      <p>They  are aided once again by one of Denise’s drawings:</p>
      <p>[Crane  2\Crane 2 Drawings\Drawing4-3.pdf]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Hank  checks the team’s progress, showing more appreciation as he does:</p>
      <p>[Checking  Progress 4-5.mp3, 9 min.]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  	 <div class="transcript"> 
      <p> They are  looking at the diagram which Denise is explaining.</p>
      <p> Hank:Are u  able to pass structures?</p>
      <p> Denise  explains how init runs and affects other S functions.</p>
      <p> Hank asks what  some of the functions do. Specially init. </p>
      <p> Hank:
          <!-- Examining the chart, Hank has a small epiphany about part of the code. He appears highly impressed with the chart, and expresses his praise for it rather profusely. -->
        Oh that is sweet! That makes sense now. So when  this one is high, that value becomes high and this one goes low, that  value is low. I finally get it.</p>
      <p> Hank: What is  setup?</p>
      <p> Denise  explains what setup is.</p>
      <p> Hank: I love  it. I love it! The beauty of something like this is that I can  understand it. Someone with a high level of knowledge of how the code  or the function works can look at it and completely understand it.</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> Denise: How  does simulink use static variables.?</p>
      <p> Hank: It is a  C question, let us separate simulink and C here. Is it how C does it?</p>
      <p> Denise: I know  how C would do it, but I wanted to know if it can be done the same  way in C.</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> (more  discussion on updating static variables in simulink and C)</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> Hank: We have  a couple of minutes, let us test that. We could write a small piece  of C code and we could try the same thing in simulink. But I think it  cant be done.</p>
      <p> Denise: Yeah,  I guess cause I know how malloc does it, but I don't know how  simulink would do it.</p>
      <p> Do we still  want to try writing the code quickly now.</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> (more code  discussion)</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> Denise: So we  might have to change all of our structs into vectors, because passing  structs might be a issue.</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> Hank: So
          <!-- Hank taking his regular update, but this time, his tone is far less formal. -->
        what timeline is there for next week.</p>
      <p> Denise: We  might have an adjustable model, not a working piece. We will have  most of the functions ready except solution. Solution is going to  take more time.</p>
      <p> Hank: I'm not  sure what the issue is with solution.</p>
      <p> Denise: It is  like 3 pages of stuff that checks dead man vs dead man old and  control mode vs control mode old.</p>
      <p> Bob: And that  is another issue, we dont know how many inputs solution takes.</p>
      <p> Hank:
          <!--  -->
        I dont know</p>
      <p> Hank: (looking  at Denise's pages of notes about solution)This is cool. Denise you  know this code probably better than anyone at this point.</p>
      <p>After  this they were checking through the list of functions and whether  they are done.</p>
      <p>Then  they discussed what Denise Justin and Bob were doing, who took which  functions.</p>
      <p>They  established that the helper functions are not complete. And that they  need to be putting it together, </p>
     
      <p>We  could run a test to see if simulink understands static variables.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Bob,</p>
      <p>thats  ok, we just talked with Hank about how simulink uses C code, what  functionality the solution() function in PCS.C does, and he looked  over our model (which he loved).</p>
      <p>We  will have a team meeting Thursday 1-2 to discuss what we've  accomplished so far &amp; <a class="tooltip">our plans for this weekend.
          <span class="classic"><p> Denise uses a 'we' message to establish what she is expecting the team to do next. She is setting a short term goal for everyone, but far less subtly this time, than before. </p></span></a>
        We really want to have completed moving all of  control() over to Simulink by next Tuesday's meeting.</p>

      <p>Reminder:</p>
      <p>Meeting  12:30, Thursday 3/31/05, Rehki 114</p>
      
	  
	  </div>
      <p>The  team spends some time trying to “figure things out” about the  code, Matlab and the project in general:</p>
      <p>[Matlab-Code-Project  3-31.mp.3, 14 min.]</p>

      <p>There  is discussion on points of contention from their previous discussion  with Hank. The team asks themselves the following questions:</p>
      <p>Should  we be using structs or pass things in vectors as Hank had suggested  before?</p>
      <p>How  does input from the joystick come in? Input values, or vectors or  sine wave?</p>
      <p>
	  What  are multiplexers and <a class="tooltip">how is the code using them?
        <span class="classic"> <p>We see the change in how structured and productive the internal team meetings are. The team members appear more focused than they have been in the past, and appear to be more aligned with their goals. </p></span></a>
        </p>
      <p><BR>
          <BR>
      </p>
      <p>They  also revisit what Hank wants:</p>
      <p>[Client  Wants.mp3, 2 min.]</p>
      <p>The  team recaps part of the discussion with Hank about Inverse kinematics</p>
      <p>They  discuss that they just want command motor. And some discussion is  there towards the end about the fact that the sponsors are coming  sometime during exam week.</p>
      
	 <div class="transcript"> 
      <p> Justin: How  come Hank wants us to do those work vectors or whatever, in case we  want to recompile it back into C, what is the purpose?</p>
      <p>
        <!-- The team is discussing an important question about reasons for major strategy. -->
        Denise:  it took so much work to convert it from C to matlab just to convert  it back.</p>
      <p> Bob: Maybe  that is what the summer job was. That is why he wants us back next  summer.</p>
      <p> Denise: It  better pay very well if we are doing this</p>
      <p> (more  discussion on code variables)</p>
    </div> 
      <p>And  revise their responsibilities:</p>
      <p>[Team  Resp 3-31.mp3, 8 min.]</p>
      <p>The  team discusses what init does and what solution does. These are  different blocks of code.</p>
      <p>Solution  calculates the input swing, like the pre-init.</p>
      <p><BR>
      </p>
      <div class="transcript">
	  <p> Denise: I am  not leaving this building for at least 5 hours.</p>
      <p> Justin: So we  should be passing the structs as vectors? Why cant be pass the  structs?</p>
      <p> Bob: We cant.</p>
      <p> Denise: We  cant pass them because S function does not know what a struct is.</p>
      <p> Bob: We are  putting this code to this block and then that code to that block,how  do we know whether it will execute at the right time.</p>
      <p> Denise: we are  just putting it together and see if it will work.</p>
      <p> (more code  discussion)</p>
      <p> Justin: What  is the point of initializing this function?</p>
      <p> Denise: It is  not initializing them, it is just calling them, and it has a point  array which it takes by reference and changes that.</p>
      <p> (more code  discussion)</p>
      <p> Justin: Is  solution calling this? Or is solution the last thing on the list that  spits it out.</p>
      <p> Denise: Yes  solution calls it. Solution we are going to try and preserve.</p>
      <p> Justin: So  what is init doing.</p>
      <p> Denise: init  is just initializing value.</p>
      <p> Justin: So how  does solution affect swing angle.</p>
      <p> Denise:  Solution calls the value and updates the swing angle. Solution is the  function in CS which calls everything else.</p>
      <p> Justin: So  solution is what starts everything off.</p>
      <p> Denise: it  initializes the control stuff and the analog input </p>
      <p> Justin: so, It  is kind of like a pre-init. Before the init.</p>
      <p> Bob: when time  are we meeting next week?</p>
      <p> Denise: Do you  guys want to meet before meeting with Hank or after meeting with  Hank.</p>
      <p> (regular  banter)</p>
      <p> Denise:  Alright does everyone have enough stuff to do this weekend?</p>

      <p>Subject:  other stuff that is on my mind</p>

      <p>&gt;You  mentioned that you would not be at the Senior Design meetings  tomorrow or next Thursday, are &gt;there any topics you want us to  address? We will keep you posted of any important information. Is  &gt;there anything specific you want from our group for the end of  the semester? We would like to begin &gt;working on it soon if  possible.</p>

      <p>&gt;Denise</p>
      
      <p>Good  question.&nbsp; What other miseries can I impose on you?...&nbsp; I  think it would be nice to have a demo and code review with Hank and  me in attendance.&nbsp; Let's schedule something a little before the  end of the semester, so that you can make changes accordingly.&nbsp;  How about week 13?</p>
      
      <p>I'm  wondering how we can document your knowledge of the C code, so that  others can use it.&nbsp; Can you think about how to take your  internal knowledge, and that scary hand-drawn picture, and turn them  into something understandable to others?</p>

      <p>Hey  all,</p>
      <p>I  got the matlab model attached, as well as the individual c files for  editing.&nbsp; Right now it does nothing, but looks pretty.&nbsp; I  figured for name consistency I'd throw in the c files, I'll get the  helper.h file done probably sometime on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Dave,  I made a screenshot so you can view the model without having matlab.</p>

      <p>Realized  it probably would be good to have the new .c files with the right  port size and adjusted number of ports.</p>

      <p>Here  is what I have put together this weekend:</p>
      <p>setup.M  - creates a params vector with 96 items that needs to be included in  all s-functions defines.h - #define global values, reads in the  params[] and sets defined constants equal to their values.</p>
      <p>struct.h  - #defines used in converting stuctures to vectors, read for more  explination init.c - S-Function for intialization</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Could  we all meet at 11:45 to discuss our progress this weekend?</p>

      <p>Subject:  Not sure if I will make meeting...</p>
      
      <p>Team,</p>
      
      <p>My  car is currently not able to start, I have been having problems with  it recently. I am working on getting a ride to the meeting as we  speak. I will try and make the meeting. Not sure if you will get this  message before the meeting is over.</p>
      
      <p>Sorry</p>

      <p>The  meeting with Hank begins with the CS team searching for definition of  some terms and what those terms ‘do’—deadman leads, how the  controller “jumps in the middle’ at about 7 minutes in, followed  by an explanation of encoders:</p>
      <p>[Defining  Terms &amp; Functions 4-5.mp3, 18 min.]</p>
      <p><BR>
      </p>

      <p>There  is a discussion about the parameters dead man vs dead man old and  corresponding modes control mode vs control mode old. They also  discuss with Hank that another parameter pedestal wont change but one  needs to have it in the code. They then move on to discuss an object  or struct for the <a class="tooltip">ship parameters and values.
          <span class="classic"><p>The nature in which Hank inquires into the team's understanding this time, is far less in the nature of assessing them, and reflective of the greater amount of confidence he has in them at this point. He asks about the team's understanding here only to decide how far he needs to explain the concept to them, and not so much to judge their efforts. </p></span></p>
        Hank asks if the team has examined where these  variables are used.</p>
      <p>Hank  then moves on to describe the role of encoders, in that encoders are  measuring the boom angle. He asks if this gets calculated somewhere  in the code.</p>
      <p>There  is more discussion about the parameters and values used in the code.  At one point in the discussion Hank comments that Denise knows this  code better than anyone.</p>
      <p>The  discussion moves on to other topics like how Inverse kin is called  according to where you want the ship to be based on the crane  position. Hank explains how joystick and nominal crane position work  together. They talk about a crane limited version of inv kin, like a  command for where u want the crane to be. Hank demonstrates how an  encoder works, and explains what the dead man is.</p>
      <p><BR>
      </p>
      <p>They  are aided once again by one of Denise’s drawings:</p>
      <p>[Crane  2\Crane 2 Drawings\Drawing4-3.pdf]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Hank  checks the team’s progress, showing more appreciation as he does:</p>
      <p>[Checking  Progress 4-5.mp3, 9 min.]</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
	  	 <div class="transcript"> 
      <p> They are  looking at the diagram which Denise is explaining.</p>
      <p> Hank:Are u  able to pass structures?</p>
      <p> Denise  explains how init runs and affects other S functions.</p>
      <p> Hank asks what  some of the functions do. Specially init. </p>
      <p> <a class="tooltip">Hank:
          <span class="classic"><p>Examining the chart, Hank has a small epiphany about part of the code. He appears highly impressed with the chart, and expresses his praise for it rather profusely. </p></span></p>
        Oh that is sweet! That makes sense now. So when  this one is high, that value becomes high and this one goes low, that  value is low. I finally get it.</p>
      <p> Hank: What is  setup?</p>
      <p> Denise  explains what setup is.</p>
      <p> Hank: I love  it. I love it! The beauty of something like this is that I can  understand it. Someone with a high level of knowledge of how the code  or the function works can look at it and completely understand it.</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> Denise: How  does simulink use static variables.?</p>
      <p> Hank: It is a  C question, let us separate simulink and C here. Is it how C does it?</p>
      <p> Denise: I know  how C would do it, but I wanted to know if it can be done the same  way in C.</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> (more  discussion on updating static variables in simulink and C)</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> Hank: We have  a couple of minutes, let us test that. We could write a small piece  of C code and we could try the same thing in simulink. But I think it  cant be done.</p>
      <p> Denise: Yeah,  I guess cause I know how malloc does it, but I don't know how  simulink would do it.</p>
      <p> Do we still  want to try writing the code quickly now.</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> (more code  discussion)</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> Denise: So we  might have to change all of our structs into vectors, because passing  structs might be a issue.</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p><a class="tooltip"> Hank: So
          <span class="classic"><p>Hank taking his regular update, but this time, his tone is far less formal. </p></span></a>
        what timeline is there for next week.</p>
      <p> Denise: We  might have an adjustable model, not a working piece. We will have  most of the functions ready except solution. Solution is going to  take more time.</p>
      <p> Hank: I'm not  sure what the issue is with solution.</p>
      <p> Denise: It is  like 3 pages of stuff that checks dead man vs dead man old and  control mode vs control mode old.</p>
      <p> Bob: And that  is another issue, we dont know how many inputs solution takes.</p>
      <p> Hank:
          <!--  -->
        I dont know</p>
      <p> Hank: (looking  at Denise's pages of notes about solution)This is cool. Denise you  know this code probably better than anyone at this point.</p>
      <p>After  this they were checking through the list of functions and whether  they are done.</p>
      <p>Then  they discussed what Denise Justin and Bob were doing, who took which  functions.</p>
      <p>They  established that the helper functions are not complete. And that they  need to be putting it together, </p>
     
      <p>We  could run a test to see if simulink understands static variables.</p>

      <p>From:  Denise</p>
      <p>To:  &quot;Crane Team&quot; &lt;crane-cs-l@mtu.edu&gt;</p>
      <p>Bob,</p>
      <p>thats  ok, we just talked with Hank about how simulink uses C code, what  functionality the solution() function in PCS.C does, and he looked  over our model (which he loved).</p>
      <p>We  will have a team meeting Thursday 1-2 to discuss what we've  accomplished so far &amp; <a class="tooltip">our plans for this weekend.
          <span class="classic"><p> Denise uses a 'we' message to establish what she is expecting the team to do next. She is setting a short term goal for everyone, but far less subtly this time, than before. </p></span></a>
        We really want to have completed moving all of  control() over to Simulink by next Tuesday's meeting.</p>
