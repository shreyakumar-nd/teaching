  <p><U><strong>Example of Micro Pattern:</strong></U></p>
  <p><em><strong>Reminiscing </strong></em></p>
  <p>Reminiscing, either fondly or  otherwise. The sentence construction used is sometimes a direct  comparison, and sometimes to express how impressed they are with  things currently as compared to before. In most cases the speech is  direct, and in some cases, they try to defend the situation in the  previous project while still comparing to say that they are happy  with things now.</p>
  <p><strong>Cause:</strong></p>
  <p> The reasons for comparison are many,  the first and foremost being just plain human tendency to compare.  The comparisons are made sometimes to serve as indirect warnings to  indicate what kind of behavior will not be tolerated and what kind of  behavior is expected. Sometimes the comparisons are made to stress  what is being done well and to encourage that. A positive comparison  is usually to serve as encouragement and appreciation.</p>
  <p><strong>Effect:</strong></p>
  <p>The  effect of the positive comparisons may be to make the team members  feel more motivated to perform better. They also might feel driven to  perform better because they know they are being compared to a  previous standard and would want to be thought of positively. The  team members also know what is expected of them and learn of some  behavior to not engage in explicitly, and can keep their guard up  more. The client would feel like he/she has conveyed their  expectations clearly and explained the repercussions of those  expectations not being met.</p>
  <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
  <p>“Bob:
    <!-- Bob recanting his experience from last semester, and comparing how pleased he was with the current team, and the progress that was being made. -->
    I  wish you guys were on my team last semester,  cause this would have been done. Our partner was never coming to the  meetings, and Joann tried, but it took her time to understand the  code, and was concerned about getting it finished, but we would have  many very long meetings and we would just sit there.”  “Bob:  I am surprised we have got so far. I never thought we would. In the  last semester, we did not get anything done. ”  “Hank:
  <!-- Hank appreciates that he is being asked specific questions which indicate that Denise had given it some thought. -->
    Yes,  that is a pretty good question.
  <!-- What is probably happening here is that Hank is subtly describing what his expectation was from S1, about the code-breakdown, and the skeletal map and HE did some of that, instead of the team. And also that that is what he expects the S2 team to accomplish among other things.     Q: How confident from what has been said, would you as a S2 team member be of what expectations Hank may have of you. Was this clearly worded? -->
  <!-- A small reference to what Hank had hoped to accomplish the previous semester. -->
    Last  semester, we kept trying to define how to proceed, and I kept  suggesting that we make a skeleton of the code, [S1]  and  how I did that was by writing the names of the blocks and what they  did in the code. And that is the kind of thing I would hope to happen  here and how you want to organize the code. ”  “Hank:
  <!-- Here Hank is sharing what might be his disappointment with not having had the bucketizing done in Seabase I -->
    That  was a big road block last semester, that is getting the data into  these two bins. ”  “Hank:  send  me something somewhat organized. From the last group I used to get  these hand scratches, piece of paper, stand in notes, to look over.  You  want to rise to a level of, hate to use the word professional, but  something more organized. In that case,
  <!-- Hank mentions his experience as an example of behavior that he does not want to witness from the Seabase 2 team. He is very clear about the form and nature of material he wants to review, something perhaps that he had not done with S1, probably due to his lack in confidence in their commitment. -->
    I  gave up on them, and just started doing the analysis myself”  “Bob:
  <!-- Bob attempts to defend their efforts in the previous semester in the face of Denise's remark. -->
    We  did well, but I was surprised, because we did not accomplish  anything.”</p>
