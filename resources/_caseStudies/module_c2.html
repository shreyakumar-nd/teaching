      <p><strong>Sunday,  20th February 2005 – Saturday 26th February  2005</strong></p>
      <p>For  the third meeting with Hank, Justin sends out an email to the rest of  the team, sharing a sketch of his matlab code:</p>
      <p><strong>Date:  Mon, 21 Feb 2005 17:37:03 -0500</strong></p>
      <p>From:  Justin </p>
      <p>Subject:  Top-down overview</p>
      <p>Sender:  owner-crane-cs-l@mtu.edu</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Here  is what I've put together for the meeting with Hank tomorrow...&nbsp; </p>
      <p>It's  a (hopefully good) draft for the skeleton of our matlab code, just  email me with any suggestions.</p>
      <p>-Justin</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Attachment  Converted: &quot;Crane 2\Attach\Crane.jpg&quot;</p>
	  </div>
      <p>The  2-22 meeting starts with Bob explaining how he could not get the  initial values from the ME team, as they did not have a meeting, but  rescheduled it. Hank provides some advice on how to have productive  meetings, and fills in the initial values question where he can.</p>
      <p>[Intra-Team  Values 2-22.mp3, 11min.]</p>
      <div class="transcript">
	  <p> Bob: Some  folks from the other team got back to me, but they were not able to  meet themselves this week. We will get together later in the week on  Thursday.</p>
      <p> Hank: What do  you hope to get out of that meeting?</p>
      <p> Bob: See how  they are testing code, and how they are using Simulink</p>
      <p> Hank: The  reason to have that meeting with them was to understand their system,  right? Specifically.</p>
      <p> Bob: Trying to  see what values they are using for Simulink</p>
      <p> Hank:Like  sensors...</p>
      <p> Bob: Yes, like  sensors, values for testing</p>
      <p> Hank: So
          <!--  -->
        what you might want before that meeting is the  things you need, like the sensors list that you would need.  You wont have a list and they wont have a list, but since you folks  have the diagram for that block. Do you know from that what values  you will need?</p>
      <p> [They look at  the diagram and discuss some input parameters like sway, swing angle,  hoist, lock, etc.]</p>
      <p> Hank: It might  be a good idea to have this picture when you talk to them.</p>
      <p> Justin: There  are 11 values that we need from them.</p>
      <p> Hank: Do you  have a list of the values?</p>
      <p> [They discuss  the relevance of some of values and start making a list together, led  by Hank and then taking the opinion of the CS team folks, attempting  to decide what they need]</p>
      <p> Hank: Ok, here  is a low-level question .How do you want to go about it when you meet  them then? You are at the interface, you provide them the list of  things you need.</p>
      <p> Keep in mind  that they are a senior design group team just like the platform team.  It would be good if you have that dialogue with them. I guess what I  am trying to say is that you might not get a quick answer. They  should know, but they might not.</p>
      <p> [Hank  describes the real-world meaning of some of the values and how they  are calculated and measured. Hank then makes suggestions about how to  use the inputs in the code and also of how to coordinate with the  other team.]</p>
      <p> Hank: You may  want to incorporate all the inputs into a large data structure and  introduce that into your code.
          <!--  -->
        Or you may want to use it separately. I  dont know, there may be advantages to both approaches. You might want  to ask them to show you some of the other inputs.</p>
      <p> <BR>Hank,  as the client, still guides the meeting, even at the end when team  responsibilities are established.</p>
      <p>[Client  Guides.mp3, 6 min.] </p>
      <p>Hank  describes what he would prefer the team do different from the  previous team.</p>
      <p>Matlab  discussion on input parameters and how matlab is machine dependent.  Some c functions are machine dependent. </p>
      <p><BR>
      Hank:  What do you want to do next?</p>
      <p> Denise:  Hypothesizing about H files and structures which are present  everywhere, we were planning to put things together so that we can  see how they work.</p>
      <p> Hank:  You were going to put them together as S functions. You mentioned  that things hadn't gone as fast as you'd hoped. There could be two  reasons for that. I am not trying to pass the blame but it usually  comes down to two things, that it is a time on hand or you're stuck.
          <!-- -->
        If it is a time issue, then I know you'll find  time, but if you're stuck then I need to know.</p>
      <p> Denise:  I've been sick. I was ill last week, and definitely not fine on  Thursday and Friday.</p>
      <p> Hank:  So there are no big issues like understanding or functions not  working, virus or bugs in the code.</p>
      <p> Denise:  No it is completely me being sick.</p>
      <p> Hank:  (directed at Bob and Justin) And then what do you want to do next?</p>
      <p> Justin  : trying to get a matlab diagram, trying to get it, but not sure yet  how to get that done. </p>
      <p> Bob:  This week I've been busy with exams, next week I will sit down and  start matlab functions going. Once I get these values, and I will  probably start. I'll try to implement small matlab functions. Justin  has got the top down approach, I will have the bottom up approach.</p>
      <p> Hank:  There is a lot of technical information I could give you, but you  need to Tell me to figure it out, this is the high level stuff I need  to know to be able to finish this project. Asking those questions. It  is important that someone is looking at it from a high level  standpoint and that everyone else is looking at it from a low level.  Also, I'm not going to be here next week, certainly if there are any  questions, feel free to email me. But let me qualify that, if you are  looking at all these functions and trying put them in these bins,  send me something somewhat organized. From the last group I used to  get these hand scratches, piece of paper, stand in notes, to look  over. You want to rise to a level of, hate to use the word  professional, but something more organized. In that case,
          <!-- . -->
       I gave up on them, and just started doing the analysis myself. [S1]</p>
      <p> Denise:  Next week we will be on spring break, even  seniors get spring break. </p>
      <p> Hank  : Do seniors really need spring break?</p>
      <p> Denise:
          <!--  -->
        Yes, we go to visit our families.</p>
      <p> Hank  : Ok, I'll be available so send me any questions on email. Is anyone  going anyplace interesting?</p>
      <p> Justin:  Just home.</p>
      <p> Hank:  Ok, lets wind up.</p>
	  </div>
	  
      <p> But the  discussion becomes more collegial, less “student-teacher”, as  they move to a laptop and discuss Matlab.</p>
      <p>[Matlab  2-22.mp3, 14 min.]</p>
      <div class="transcript">
	  <p>The  discussion is while they are looking at Hank's laptop and watching  him do things on his machine.</p>
      <p>Some  technical issues arise, centered around access to the ME computer  labs. This is necessary since Matlab is not installed on the  computers in the CS department.</p>
      <p>[Access  2-22.mp3, 5min.]</p>
      <p>Justin:  I'll get a webpage going.</p>
      <p> Denise:  I'll get a directory going for all of this.</p>
      <p> Justin:  We can ask Dave if we can get our passwords changed.</p>
      <p> Denise:  it would make sense to have matlab on the CS machines, so we could  work in our labs.</p>
      <p> Justin:  I was thinking more along the lines of being able to use matab  wherever we are working from.</p>
      <p> Denise:  I was actually able to use ftp to log into colossus, it let us log in  last week so we could look into that.</p>
      <p> [Denise  describes some of the problems she has been having with the Access is  further detail]</p>
      <p> Hank:  Do they work now?</p>
      <p> Denise:  I don't know about the last two days.</p>
      <p> Hank:  Were you able to log in before?</p>
      <p> Keep  me in the loop, sometimes non-ME students have difficulty logging in,  since their logins are lower in the priority stack. Keep me in the  loop if you have trouble logging in. </p>
      <p> Justin:  Yeah, I dont want that to slow us down.</p>
      <p> Hank:  Let us check now,</p>
      <p> [Hank  shows the team some of the steps on his machine]</p>
      <p> Hank:  So, you want to make a directory in the C drive, so everyone can know  where it is, and you can access it working from elsewhere, using your  email access.</p>
      <p> So  if you just create a directory and change permissions?</p>
      <p> Denise:  Yeah, I suppose we could try that.</p>
      <p> Hank:  See, if that works, if that doesn't work, we could look into how else  that can be done.</p>

		   <p>For  the third meeting with Hank, Justin sends out an email to the rest of  the team, sharing a sketch of his matlab code:</p>
		   <p><strong>Date:  Mon, 21 Feb 2005 17:37:03 -0500</strong></p>
		   <p>From:  Justin </p>
		   <p>Subject:  Top-down overview</p>
		   <p>Sender:  owner-crane-cs-l@mtu.edu</p>
		   <p>&nbsp;</p>
		   <p>Here  is what I've put together for the meeting with Hank tomorrow...&nbsp; </p>
		   <p>It's  a (hopefully good) draft for the skeleton of our matlab code, just  email me with any suggestions.</p>

		 <p>The  2-22 meeting starts with Bob explaining how he could not get the  initial values from the ME team, as they did not have a meeting, but  rescheduled it. Hank provides some advice on how to have productive  meetings, and fills in the initial values question where he can.</p>
		 <p>[Intra-Team  Values 2-22.mp3, 11min.]</p>
		 <div class="transcript">
           <p> Bob: Some  folks from the other team got back to me, but they were not able to  meet themselves this week. We will get together later in the week on  Thursday.</p>
		   <p> Hank: What do  you hope to get out of that meeting?</p>
		   <p> Bob: See how  they are testing code, and how they are using Simulink</p>
		   <p> Hank: The  reason to have that meeting with them was to understand their system,  right? Specifically.</p>
		   <p> Bob: Trying to  see what values they are using for Simulink</p>
		   <p> Hank:Like  sensors...</p>
		   <p> Bob: Yes, like  sensors, values for testing</p>
		   <p> Hank: So

           <a class="tooltip"> what you might want <span class="classic">
             <p>Hank is giving the team advice on how to make their meeting with the ME team more productive.</p>
             </span></a>before that meeting is the  things you need, like the sensors list that you would need.  You wont have a list and they wont have a list, but since you folks  have the diagram for that block. Do you know from that what values  you will need?
		   </p>
           <p> [They look at  the diagram and discuss some input parameters like sway, swing angle,  hoist, lock, etc.]</p>
		   <p> Hank: It might  be a good idea to have this picture when you talk to them.</p>
		   <p> Justin: There  are 11 values that we need from them.</p>
		   <p> Hank: Do you  have a list of the values?</p>
		   <p> [They discuss  the relevance of some of values and start making a list together, led  by Hank and then taking the opinion of the CS team folks, attempting  to decide what they need]</p>
		   <p> Hank: Ok, here  is a low-level question .How do you want to go about it when you meet  them then? You are at the interface, you provide them the list of  things you need.</p>
		   <p> Keep in mind  that they are a senior design group team just like the platform team.  It would be good if you have that dialogue with them. I guess what I  am trying to say is that you might not get a quick answer. They  should know, but they might not.</p>
		   <p> [Hank  describes the real-world meaning of some of the values and how they  are calculated and measured. Hank then makes suggestions about how to  use the inputs in the code and also of how to coordinate with the  other team.]</p>
		   <p> Hank: You may  want to incorporate all the inputs into a large data structure and  introduce that into your code.
		     <!--  -->
           <a class="tooltip">Or you may<span class="classic">
             <p>Hank is teaching the team how to strategize to make the meeting and their work more effective. At this point, Hank appears to have full faith in the team's abilities and seems to want to help them as a mentor.</p>
             </span></a> want to use it separately. I  dont know, there may be advantages to both approaches. You might want  to ask them to show you some of the other inputs.
		   </p>
           <p> <BR>
             Hank,  as the client, still guides the meeting, even at the end when team  responsibilities are established.</p>
		   <p>[Client  Guides.mp3, 6 min.] </p>
		   <p>Hank  describes what he would prefer the team do different from the  previous team.</p>
		   <p>Matlab  discussion on input parameters and how matlab is machine dependent.  Some c functions are machine dependent. </p>
		   <p><BR>
		     Hank:  What do you want to do next?</p>
		   <p> Denise:  Hypothesizing about H files and structures which are present  everywhere, we were planning to put things together so that we can  see how they work.</p>
		   <p> Hank:  You were going to put them together as S functions. You mentioned  that things hadn't gone as fast as you'd hoped. There could be two  reasons for that. I am not trying to pass the blame but it usually  comes down to two things, that it is a time on hand or you're stuck.
		     <!-- -->
           <a class="tooltip"> If it is a time issue, <span class="classic">
             <p> Again, Hank is inquiring about the team's plan and progress, but now, he explicitly states that he knows they will make time for it, and he is offering help if they need technical assistance.</p>
             </span></a>then I know you'll find  time, but if you're stuck then I need to know.
		   </p>
           <p> Denise:  I've been sick. I was ill last week, and definitely not fine on  Thursday and Friday.</p>
		   <p> Hank:  So there are no big issues like understanding or functions not  working, virus or bugs in the code.</p>
		   <p> Denise:  No it is completely me being sick.</p>
		   <p> Hank:  (directed at Bob and Justin) And then what do you want to do next?</p>
		   <p> Justin  : trying to get a matlab diagram, trying to get it, but not sure yet  how to get that done. </p>
		   <p> Bob:  This week I've been busy with exams, next week I will sit down and  start matlab functions going. Once I get these values, and I will  probably start. I'll try to implement small matlab functions. Justin  has got the top down approach, I will have the bottom up approach.</p>
		   <p> Hank:  There is a lot of technical information I could give you, but you  need to Tell me to figure it out, this is the high level stuff I need  to know to be able to finish this project. Asking those questions. It  is important that someone is looking at it from a high level  standpoint and that everyone else is looking at it from a low level.  Also, I'm not going to be here next week, certainly if there are any  questions, feel free to email me. But let me qualify that, if you are  looking at all these functions and trying put them in these bins,  send me something somewhat organized. From the last group I used to  get these hand scratches, piece of paper, stand in notes, to look  over. You want to rise to a level of, hate to use the word  professional, but something more organized. In that case,

           <a class="tooltip"> I gave up on them, <span class="classic">
             <p>Hank mentions his experience as an example of behavior that he does not want to witness from the Seabase 2 team. He is very clear about the form and nature of material he wants to review, something perhaps that he had not done with S1, probably due to his lack in confidence in their commitment</p>
             </span></a>and just started doing the analysis myself. [S1]
		   </p>
           <p> Denise:  Next week we will be on spring break, even  seniors get spring break. </p>
		   <p> Hank  : Do seniors really need spring break?</p>
		   <p> Denise:
		     <!--  -->
		     Yes,          
		   <a class="tooltip">we go <span class="classic">
		     <p>Denise decides to speak up for the team, and tell Hank that they will not be available over Spring Break. Notice how  Denise makes sure she tells Hank, instead of asking, ensuring that the issue is not something that is open for discussion.</p>
		     </span></a>to visit our families.
		   </p>
           <p> Hank  : Ok, I'll be available so send me any questions on email. Is anyone  going anyplace interesting?</p>
		   <p> Justin:  Just home.</p>
		   <p> Hank:  Ok, lets wind up.</p>
	    </div>
		 <p> But the  discussion becomes more collegial, less “student-teacher”, as  they move to a laptop and discuss Matlab.</p>
		 <p>[Matlab  2-22.mp3, 14 min.]</p>
		 <div class="transcript">
           <p>The  discussion is while they are looking at Hank's laptop and watching  him do things on his machine.</p>
		   <p>Some  technical issues arise, centered around access to the ME computer  labs. This is necessary since Matlab is not installed on the  computers in the CS department.</p>
		   <p>[Access  2-22.mp3, 5min.]</p>
		   <p>Justin:  I'll get a webpage going.</p>
		   <p> Denise:  I'll get a directory going for all of this.</p>
		   <p> Justin:  We can ask Dave if we can get our passwords changed.</p>
		   <p> Denise:  it would make sense to have matlab on the CS machines, so we could  work in our labs.</p>
		   <p> Justin:  I was thinking more along the lines of being able to use matab  wherever we are working from.</p>
		   <p> Denise:  I was actually able to use ftp to log into colossus, it let us log in  last week so we could look into that.</p>
		   <p> [Denise  describes some of the problems she has been having with the Access is  further detail]</p>
		   <p> Hank:  Do they work now?</p>
		   <p> Denise:  I don't know about the last two days.</p>
		   <p> Hank:  Were you able to log in before?</p>
		   <p> Keep  me in the loop, sometimes non-ME students have difficulty logging in,  since their logins are lower in the priority stack. Keep me in the  loop if you have trouble logging in. </p>
		   <p> Justin:  Yeah, I dont want that to slow us down.</p>
		   <p> Hank:  Let us check now,</p>
		   <p> [Hank  shows the team some of the steps on his machine]</p>
		   <p> Hank:  So, you want to make a directory in the C drive, so everyone can know  where it is, and you can access it working from elsewhere, using your  email access.</p>
		   <p> So  if you just create a directory and change permissions?</p>
		   <p> Denise:  Yeah, I suppose we could try that.</p>
		   <p> Hank:  See, if that works, if that doesn't work, we could look into how else  that can be done.</p>
