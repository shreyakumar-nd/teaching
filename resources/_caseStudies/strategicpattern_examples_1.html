  <p><U><strong>Examples  of Strategic Patterns</strong></U></p>
  <p><U><strong>Pattern:</strong></U></p>
  <p><em><strong>Meeting Minutes</strong></em></p>
  <p><strong>Brief  Description: </strong> </p>
  <p>Meeting  Minutes are supposed to capture what is discussed and decided in a  particular meeting, usually by a designated attendee, and are meant  for all attendees and other people from the project to keep track of  progress and decisions, for purposes of maintaining accountability,  monitoring and record keeping.</p>
  <p><strong>WHAT</strong> The decision to take notes for all meetings as the responsibility of  one of the team members, and communicating that to the rest of the  members concerned regularly. The artifact of communication in this  case are the meeting minutes. It can be considered a written history  of conversation, perhaps not word for word.</p>
  <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>WHERE </strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> The  	meeting minutes pattern normally occurs during regularly scheduled  	meetings or ad hoc meetings, either in person or over tele or video  	conferencing. Minutes can be taken at any meeting, but are normally  	taken in formal, multi-party meetings, which may of a slightly  	formal nature. </LI>
    <LI> Minutes  	are not usually taken at meetings of the form of directed  	presentations or brainstorming sessions. They are considered more  	useful for meetings where some sort of decision making or task  	allocation or progress update is discussed.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>WHO </strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> Usually  	one person, the designated Point of Contact or Scribe would be  	responsible to take down the meeting minutes. </LI>
    <LI> The  	attendees of the meeting, among other people at managerial posts are  	the intended audience for the meeting minutes. </LI>
    <LI> The  	meetings are meant for internal consumption and are not the type of  	communication artifact that would be publicly available.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Style:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>HOW</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> The  	style of this communication pattern is formal. </LI>
    <LI> The  	level of detail captured in the meeting minutes would vary depending  	on the need from attendees or just what is an agreed-to level of  	granularity. Minutes can be as detailed as a transcript of the  	entire conversation, which in most cases would seem unnecessary, or  	just capturing the main action points that emerged in the meeting as  	they would be the only relevant decisions that would be useful at a  	later time, like the next meeting.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>WHY</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> The  	management goal of having a designated point of contact keeping the  	communication streamlined and consistent, and having a record of all  	communication and decisions for reference. </LI>
    <LI> It  	facilitates better team management. Within this management pattern,  	there exist different communication patterns associated with the  	point of contact. Meeting minutes are one of them.</LI>
    <LI> Minutes  	can serve as a means of keeping track of attendance and  	participation. Some managers might find this a useful tool.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Benefits  Analysis:</strong></p>
  <UL>
    <LI> All  	the discussions, and decisions of all meetings are saved for record  	keeping purposes, to learn from, resolve communication discrepancies  	later, to allow non-attendees to catch up and to remind everyone of  	the state of the discussion.</LI>
    <LI> Also,  	as a point of contact keeps the meeting minutes, it is a good chance  	that the scribe would not be actively participating as much as the  	team members talking but would be paying attention through all of  	it. </LI>
    <LI> As  	one person is the scribe, all the communication would tend to be  	consistent and follow the same type of style, depth and structure.</LI>
    <LI> If  	participants know that the communication is being recorded in some  	form, they feel the need to participate more actively, as one would  	under observation. In some cases, it encourages participation.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Risks:</strong></p>
  <UL>
    <LI> The  	risks associated with taking meeting minutes is that more often than  	not, no one reads them. </LI>
    <LI> In  	the absence of their eventual use, they might be considered a waste  	of time and resources. </LI>
    <LI> Also,  	the decision to keep meeting minutes might often be associated with  	following the norm as opposed to actually acknowledging its benefits  	and accordingly wanting to use it.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><U><strong>Example:</strong></U></p>
  <p>JoAnn  was designated the point of contact in the Seabase I project, her  responsibilities included taking notes for all meetings, informing  everyone of progress, keeping her team members up-to-date with any  communication or decisions.</p>
  <p>Contrarily,  Seabase II did not have a strategically designated point of contact,  however Denise did start performing that role to some extent. As in  Seabase II, it was not a strategic move, it can be considered a  tactical pattern and is described in that section.</p>
