  <p><U><strong>Examples  of Micro Patterns:</strong></U><BR>
  </p>
  <p><U><strong>Pattern:</strong></U></p>
  <p> Leading and taking updates. Sentence  construction here is such that the team member taking updates is very  direct about wanting to know of progress, and is not using any form  of veiling of the intention.</p>
  <p><strong>Cause:</strong></p>
  <p> The direct form of communication may  be used because this is communication between peers, and they feel  that they can dispense with formalities. Also, as they are all young  students, they may not feel the need to formally address each other  or to use motivational tactics like positive speech or passive active  voice.</p>
  <p><strong>Effect:</strong></p>
  <p>There  can be several possible effects of using this manner of sentence  construction when a peer is taking updates. The person who is being  addressed may get offended that they are being asked so directly,  when ideally all of the members should have an equal standing within  the team. The team member may feel comfortable that they are being  addressed directly, also possibly because the team members may be  friends and would not take offense to a friend demanding updates. The  person being addressed may feel under pressure to perform at par with  or better than the team member taking updates, specially if that team  member has been producing considerable results. The reaction can be  either very positive, or rather negative.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p>“Denise:
    <!-- Denise is clearly in charge of the team now, and one can see her taking updates, although with a friendly tone of voice, but she is making sure that they live up to Hank's expectations as a team, specially considering the fact that she has had to answer to Hank for the team's shortcomings on occasions before. -->
    Have  you done any work on that thing this week Bob?” </p>
  <p><strong>Pattern:</strong></p>
  <p>Having  difficulty contacting or receiving appropriate responses from other  teams “Bob:
    <!-- Bob highlights problems with being able to coordinate with the other ME teams, due to their lack of response. This turns out to be a significant issue later. -->
    The  crane team never sends anything out,  I  am on their mailing list and they never send anything out.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><U><strong>Pattern:</strong></U></p>
  <p><em><strong> Client inquiring about attendance at  meetings.</strong></em></p>
  <p><strong>Cause:</strong></p>
  <p> The client may out of habit want to  inquire about every member's attendance just as a common practice or  out of habit, or the client may have reason to be mindful of a team  member's habit of missing meetings. The client also uses very blunt  communication as he wants the team to know that this is something he  takes seriously.</p>
  <p><strong>Effect:</strong></p>
  <p> As a result, the team knows that the  client who is normally diplomatic thinks this is important enough for  him to be very direct about it. All team members know they should  take the matter seriously. </p>
  <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
  <p>“Hank:
    <!-- A recurring pattern where Bob is missing from meetings again, and Hank making sure that the team realizes that it is not going unnoticed. This has probably shaken his confidence a little bit, as he appears to be taking updates with a slightly more firm tone than the team had probably become accustomed to in the last few successful meetings. -->
    So  we're waiting for Bob?”  “Hank:
  <!-- Hank briefly checking, perhaps about attendance again. -->
    Is  everyone here that is going to be here? What happened?</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><U><strong>Pattern:</strong></U></p>
  <p><em><strong>Reminiscing </strong></em></p>
  <p>Reminiscing, either fondly or  otherwise. The sentence construction used is sometimes a direct  comparison, and sometimes to express how impressed they are with  things currently as compared to before. In most cases the speech is  direct, and in some cases, they try to defend the situation in the  previous project while still comparing to say that they are happy  with things now.</p>
  <p><strong>Cause:</strong></p>
  <p> The reasons for comparison are many,  the first and foremost being just plain human tendency to compare.  The comparisons are made sometimes to serve as indirect warnings to  indicate what kind of behavior will not be tolerated and what kind of  behavior is expected. Sometimes the comparisons are made to stress  what is being done well and to encourage that. A positive comparison  is usually to serve as encouragement and appreciation.</p>
  <p><strong>Effect:</strong></p>
  <p>The  effect of the positive comparisons may be to make the team members  feel more motivated to perform better. They also might feel driven to  perform better because they know they are being compared to a  previous standard and would want to be thought of positively. The  team members also know what is expected of them and learn of some  behavior to not engage in explicitly, and can keep their guard up  more. The client would feel like he/she has conveyed their  expectations clearly and explained the repercussions of those  expectations not being met.</p>
  <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
  <p>“Bob:
    <!-- Bob recanting his experience from last semester, and comparing how pleased he was with the current team, and the progress that was being made. -->
    I  wish you guys were on my team last semester,  cause this would have been done. Our partner was never coming to the  meetings, and Joann tried, but it took her time to understand the  code, and was concerned about getting it finished, but we would have  many very long meetings and we would just sit there.”  “Bob:  I am surprised we have got so far. I never thought we would. In the  last semester, we did not get anything done. ”  “Hank:
  <!-- Hank appreciates that he is being asked specific questions which indicate that Denise had given it some thought. -->
    Yes,  that is a pretty good question.
  <!-- What is probably happening here is that Hank is subtly describing what his expectation was from S1, about the code-breakdown, and the skeletal map and HE did some of that, instead of the team. And also that that is what he expects the S2 team to accomplish among other things.     Q: How confident from what has been said, would you as a S2 team member be of what expectations Hank may have of you. Was this clearly worded? -->
  <!-- A small reference to what Hank had hoped to accomplish the previous semester. -->
    Last  semester, we kept trying to define how to proceed, and I kept  suggesting that we make a skeleton of the code, [S1]  and  how I did that was by writing the names of the blocks and what they  did in the code. And that is the kind of thing I would hope to happen  here and how you want to organize the code. ”  “Hank:
  <!-- Here Hank is sharing what might be his disappointment with not having had the bucketizing done in Seabase I -->
    That  was a big road block last semester, that is getting the data into  these two bins. ”  “Hank:  send  me something somewhat organized. From the last group I used to get  these hand scratches, piece of paper, stand in notes, to look over.  You  want to rise to a level of, hate to use the word professional, but  something more organized. In that case,
  <!-- Hank mentions his experience as an example of behavior that he does not want to witness from the Seabase 2 team. He is very clear about the form and nature of material he wants to review, something perhaps that he had not done with S1, probably due to his lack in confidence in their commitment. -->
    I  gave up on them, and just started doing the analysis myself”  “Bob:
  <!-- Bob attempts to defend their efforts in the previous semester in the face of Denise's remark. -->
    We  did well, but I was surprised, because we did not accomplish  anything.”</p>
