      <p><strong>Wednesday,  6th April, 2005 – Sunday,17th April, 2005</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Story</strong></p>
      <p>The  CS team meets as a unit twice: their regular meeting on Thursday the  7th, then again in the ME building on Sunday to “run the model”,  then again for their usual Tuesday meeting with Hank.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Listen  to the parts of the meeting on the 7th, as Denise updates  Bob on the meeting he missed, and the individual members report on  “how far they got”. Listen also for the discussions of terms  (deadman again!), what Hank wants, and results of communication with  the ME team:</p>
      <p>[Team  Progress 4-7.mp3, 14 min]</p>
	  <div class="transcript"> 
      <p> Denise:  (taking updates)
        <!-- At this point in the project, Denise is directly taking updates, clearly having completely emerged as the leader in the team. -->
        How  far along are you at the code?</p>
      <p> Bob: I looked  at the stuff that you sent me. And need to change the numbering.</p>
      <p> Denise:  Changing parenthesis to brackets would work.</p>
      <p> (code  variables discussion between Justin and Denise)</p>
      <p> Denise: Did  you try a function declaration for dot?</p>
      <p> Justin: Yes, I  tried it and still doesn't work, I will have to rearrange the some  other functions that do the same thing in there.</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> Bob: What  happened in the meeting on Tuesday with Hank?</p>
      <p> Denise: We  went over the diagram .He loved the diagram. We talked a little bit  about solution and dead man and how encoders work/ He didnt care  about much else.</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> Justin:  Another problem I ran into was that error gets set in one of those  functions.</p>
      <p> Denise: I  think it gets passed. </p>
      <p> (more code  specific discussion)</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> Denise:  (checking everyone's share of responsibilities) (to Justin) Your part  is good, you know what to do with that. I gotta finish off the setup.  (to Bob) </p>
      <p> Do you guys  want to get work done over the next couple of days and meet on  Sunday. We'll meet in the MEEM, since no one has a copy of matlab on  their laptop.</p>
      <p> I will fix  setup , I've been planning on doing it but I've been lazy.
        <!-- Denise at this point, almost like a manager, goes through a mental checklist of all the issues that the team has, deciding best next steps and collecting or sharing updates, in the process. -->
        Have  we heard from the other team</p>
      <p> Bob: Nope, not  a word.</p>
      <p> Denise: I  complained to him(Hank) about not hearing from the other team. He  asked if we should tell them or he would, I told him it would be  better if he talked to them, cause we cant seem to get a response  from them, but he keeps stressing that we should talk to them about  the input, like Analog to digital and from encoders. Apparently they  are writing some code, but we are not sure.</p>
      <p> Bob: I have a  friend in the crane team, he said they are writing some code.</p>
      <p> Denise: Can  you push him for a meeting?</p>
      <p> Bob: Yes, I'll  do that.</p>
	  </div>
	  
      <p>In  this meeting it appears that Denise is in charge. It is also decided  that Denise needs to rework init. The team is seeing errors while  functions from inside .h files. inv-kin, helper.h</p>
      <p>Justin  or Bob will take the responsibility to replace and rearrange some  things in the code as per their discussion.</p>
      <p>They  are also having some problems with returning arrays, where matlab is  not allowing pointers to be returned from local context switch.</p>
      <p>Denise  reports that Hank loved the diagram. They also discussed about the  fact that some code does not work even if copied directly.</p>
      <p>Denise  shows the other two folks where all the structs are declared and how  to change specifications of a function, by double clicking.</p>
      <p>Then  they decide where to meet next.</p>
      <p><BR>
      </p>
      
      <p>The team meets and reflects on the last semester, including some gender  issues in the CS department:</p>
      <p>[Reflections  4-7.mp3, 10 min.]</p>
	  <div class="transcript">
      <p> Bob: I am  surprised we have got so far. I never thought we would. In the last  semester, we did not get anything done. One of the guys was never  around and the girl did not know anything.</p>
      <p> (discussion  about their personal preference of courses and teachers)</p>
      <p> Initial: In  the last semester Redesigning it and basing it off of the original  and then you find out that you have to port it. Hank made it sound  really simple.</p>
      <p> Denise:  and  you found out that nothing works.</p>
      <p> (more  discussion about their personal lives)</p>
      <p> Bob: When do  we do the presentation?</p>
      <p> Justin  : I don't know, probably the last week sometime. It might not take  all week. </p>
      <p> Bob:
        <!-- Bob informing of his absence in advance. -->
        I  may have to go downstate during the last week.</p>
		</div>
      <p>Denise  sends out a reminder for the meeting on Sunday the 10th :</p>
	  
	  <div class = "email">
      <p><strong>Date:  Sun, 10 Apr 2005 16:49:30 -0400 (EDT)</strong></p>
      <p>Subject:  Meeting reminder</p>
      <p>From:  Denise</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I  said I'd send a reminder, I didnt say when...</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Meeting  at 5pm today, in the 2nd floor computer classroom in the ME-EM</p>
      <p>--Denise</p>
	  </div>
	  
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>They  get together, only to find they don’t have a lot of the things they  need:</p>
      <p>[Access  4-10 mp3, 10 min.]</p>
	  <div class = "transcript">
      <p>Bob:  I will not be available for a week. And I still haven't heard  anything from those guys(other team).</p>
      <p> Denise: I  forgot I was supposed to send that data out.</p>
      <p> Justin: there  were certain things that were not working in C.</p>
      <p> Denise: Yes,  there were some things which cannot be done in C the way they are  done in Matlab.</p>
      <p> (discussion on  version of data and getting things to run, and having troubles with  the compiler)</p>
      <p> Denise: I  don't know why but the compiler is not running. Every time I try  running it , it closes saying the application has to close, We will  have to talk to Hank about that. </p>
	  </div>
      <p>In  this meeting it was revealed that compiling the code was turning out  to be a problem for Denise</p>
      <p>There  were problems with versions of matlab and simulink and whose machine  the code works on.</p>
      <p>They  were having trouble opening models in the lab in that they cannot get  the diagram to open and cannot make it run on the current machine.</p>
      <p>So  Denise and Bob leave the ME-EM mid-meeting, and email to themselves:</p>

      <p>At  the next meeting with Hank on the 12th, they discuss the  “version” problems:</p>
      <p>[Access  4-12.mp3, 4 min.]</p>
      <p>They  discussed about the issue that there was no backward compatibility  for versions of matlab, so the team could not use other machines but  could use the lab on 2nd floor or Hank's machine, since it  had both Matlab 7 and 6. Hank informed the team that the PCs  which have matlab 7 are on the 1st  floor. Hank also informed them that if they had trouble logging into  the ME building machines, that they should drop him an email.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>And  the lack of information from the other team:</p>
      <p>[Other  Team 4-12.mp3, 3 min.]</p>
      <p>Denise  tells Hank about the trouble they have been having getting a response  from the other teams.</p>
      <p>Hank  asks if they haven't responded at all.  Bob tells him that he has  been dropping them emails but without a response. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Hank  checks up on their progress:</p>
      <p>[Checking  Progress 4-12.mp3, 14 min.]</p>
	  <div class="transcript">
      <p>Hank:  So, how far did you folks get on the coding?</p>
      <p> Denise : inv kin and damping  remaining and compute S function.</p>
      <p> Hank:
          <!-- This is a regular question Hank normally asks to assess several things: one is whether the team needs his technical help,  -->
        Is it a time issue?</p>
      <p> Denise:Yes a time issue, it is just  a matter of finding the time to do it now.</p>
      <p> Hank:
        <!-- This was perhaps a trust issue, that Hank may have probably felt more confident if Denise had been working on it, as opposed to the rest of the team. -->
        Who  is working on it? And do you know what needs to be done.</p>
      <p> Justin: Yes, we know mainly what  needs to be done.</p>
      <p> The Team together tells Hank that  they were having params vector setting up troubles and global  defines. Errors that it cannot find params, replacing the THP.</p>
      <p> Hank: Do you change the params  and  then do a 'get params'?</p>
      <p>Denise  : That could be what is wrong.</p>
	  </div>
      <p>Hank  explains how to use parameters, inputs, .H and outputs .</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>In  this meeting, Denise is talking about when everyone is available and  for whatever they cannot get done, to email Denise by Saturday and
        <!-- We see here that Denise is ready to pick up in the scenario where someone else in the team is not able to do the required work within the designated time. It was true leadership on Denise's part to offer to do that, and also to consider and plan for such a contingency. -->
        she  will see if she can get it done instead. She also describes  what needs to be made and to what degree and whether it works or not. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>After  the meeting, Denise compiles the goals, and posts a “to-do”  schedule:</p>

      <p>Also,  I emailed Hank, and he wont be able to make it to a code review next  week at all, so we will either have to do it this week or without  him. Dave, what would you like to see happen? When is everyone free  this week?</p>

      <p>From:  Denise</p>
      <p>To:  crane-cs-l@mtu.edu, Hank</p>
      <p>Attached  is a zip of everything I have right now. Includes ported  compute_motor_rates.c, &nbsp;which I hadn't sent out before.
          <!-- Denise, having established her supreme knowledge of the code beyond doubt, is at this point, very confident ad comfortable with 'tweaking' Bob's code. Although, in this case, it was requested by Bob in some measure. -->
        I tweaked Bob's stuff in inv_kin_damping a little bit per his  comments; adding a for loop to copy Pi[] from Ps[], fixed his use of  vectormult (passing in the vectors by reference and modifying them in  the helper file rather than setting them to a returned value). About  the de-referencing (&quot;&gt; 132,135,and 156: Does the value need  to be dereferenced? &amp;&quot;) I dont know so I didn't change them  yet, I will look into it.</p>

      <p><strong>Questions</strong></p>
      <p>We  still see the confusion about terms and client wants. Any new  suggestions to resolve these isues?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Do  the comments about how to prepare reports and presentations reflect  how you do it? </p>
      <p>Are  their any things you do differently, and why? </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Denise  seems to be in charge when she asks about progress—“how far did  you get”?</p>
      <p>Evaluate  her and the others’ responses.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Evaluate  the reflections the team members share about last semester, and the  treatment of women in the CS department. Have you seen any of this,  in CS or other places? How would you deal with it?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The  question of access becomes critical during the 4-10 meeting. Is their  response appropriate, or can you suggest another method?</p>
      <p>They  raise the issue with Hank on the 12th. How helpful are his  responses?</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The  problems with working with the other team are discussed during all  three meetings. What might you do to avoid, or at least minimize,  these issues?</p>

        How  far along are you at the code?</p>
      <p> Bob: I looked  at the stuff that you sent me. And need to change the numbering.</p>
      <p> Denise:  Changing parenthesis to brackets would work.</p>
      <p> (code  variables discussion between Justin and Denise)</p>
      <p> Denise: Did  you try a function declaration for dot?</p>
      <p> Justin: Yes, I  tried it and still doesn't work, I will have to rearrange the some  other functions that do the same thing in there.</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> Bob: What  happened in the meeting on Tuesday with Hank?</p>
      <p> Denise: We  went over the diagram .He loved the diagram. We talked a little bit  about solution and dead man and how encoders work/ He didnt care  about much else.</p>
      <p> <BR>
      </p>
      <p> Justin:  Another problem I ran into was that error gets set in one of those  functions.</p>

        Have  we heard from the other team</p>
      <p> Bob: Nope, not  a word.</p>
      <p> Denise: I  complained to him(Hank) about not hearing from the other team. He  asked if we should tell them or he would, I told him it would be  better if he talked to them, cause we cant seem to get a response  from them, but he keeps stressing that we should talk to them about  the input, like Analog to digital and from encoders. Apparently they  are writing some code, but we are not sure.</p>
      <p> Bob: I have a  friend in the crane team, he said they are writing some code.</p>
      <p> Denise: Can  you push him for a meeting?</p>
      <p> Bob: Yes, I'll  do that.</p>

      <p>In  this meeting it appears that Denise is in charge. It is also decided  that Denise needs to rework init. The team is seeing errors while  functions from inside .h files. inv-kin, helper.h</p>
      <p>Justin  or Bob will take the responsibility to replace and rearrange some  things in the code as per their discussion.</p>
      <p>They  are also having some problems with returning arrays, where matlab is  not allowing pointers to be returned from local context switch.</p>
      <p>Denise  reports that Hank loved the diagram. They also discussed about the  fact that some code does not work even if copied directly.</p>
      <p>Denise  shows the other two folks where all the structs are declared and how  to change specifications of a function, by double clicking.</p>
      <p>Then  they decide where to meet next.</p>

      <p> Bob: I am  surprised we have got so far. I never thought we would. In the last  semester, we did not get anything done. One of the guys was never  around and the girl did not know anything.</p>

      <p> Initial: In  the last semester Redesigning it and basing it off of the original  and then you find out that you have to port it. Hank made it sound  really simple.</p>
      <p> Denise:  and  you found out that nothing works.</p>

      <p>Bob:  I will not be available for a week. And I still haven't heard  anything from those guys(other team).</p>

      <p> Justin: there  were certain things that were not working in C.</p>
      <p> Denise: Yes,  there were some things which cannot be done in C the way they are  done in Matlab.</p>
      <p> (discussion on  version of data and getting things to run, and having troubles with  the compiler)</p>
      <p> Denise: I  don't know why but the compiler is not running. Every time I try  running it , it closes saying the application has to close, We will  have to talk to Hank about that. </p>
	  </div>
      <p>In  this meeting it was revealed that compiling the code was turning out  to be a problem for Denise</p>
      <p>There  were problems with versions of matlab and simulink and whose machine  the code works on.</p>
      <p>They  were having trouble opening models in the lab in that they cannot get  the diagram to open and cannot make it run on the current machine.</p>
      <p>So  Denise and Bob leave the ME-EM mid-meeting, and email to themselves:</p>

      <p>Bob  disclosed that he had still not heard back from any of the other ME  teams that they had been <a class="tooltip">trying to contact.

      <p>At  the next meeting with Hank on the 12th, they discuss the  “version” problems:</p>
      <p>[Access  4-12.mp3, 4 min.]</p>
      <p>They  discussed about the issue that there was no backward compatibility  for versions of matlab, so the team could not use other machines but  could use the lab on 2nd floor or Hank's machine, since it  had both Matlab 7 and 6. Hank informed the team that the PCs  which have matlab 7 are on the 1st  floor. Hank also informed them that if they had trouble logging into  the ME building machines, that they should drop him an email.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>And  the lack of information from the other team:</p>
      <p>[Other  Team 4-12.mp3, 3 min.]</p>
      <p>Denise  tells Hank about the trouble they have been having getting a response  from the other teams.</p>
      <p>Hank  asks if they haven't responded at all.  Bob tells him that he has  been dropping them emails but without a response. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Hank  checks up on their progress:</p>
      <p>[Checking  Progress 4-12.mp3, 14 min.]</p>
	  <div class="transcript">
      <p>Hank:  So, how far did you folks get on the coding?</p>
      <p> Denise : inv kin and damping  remaining and compute S function.</p>
      <p> <a class="tooltip">Hank:
          <span class="classic"><p>This is a regular question Hank normally asks to assess several things: one is whether the team needs his technical help,  <p></span></a>
        Is it a time issue?</p>
      <p> Denise:Yes a time issue, it is just  a matter of finding the time to do it now.</p>
      <p> <a class="tooltip">Hank:
        <span class="classic"><p>This was perhaps a trust issue, that Hank may have probably felt more confident if Denise had been working on it, as opposed to the rest of the team. </p></span></a>
        Who  is working on it? And do you know what needs to be done.</p>
      <p> Justin: Yes, we know mainly what  needs to be done.</p>
      <p> The Team together tells Hank that  they were having params vector setting up troubles and global  defines. Errors that it cannot find params, replacing the THP.</p>
      <p> Hank: Do you change the params  and  then do a 'get params'?</p>
      <p>Denise  : That could be what is wrong.</p>
	  </div>
      <p>Hank  explains how to use parameters, inputs, .H and outputs .</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>And  they set some goals for the project:</p>
      <p>[Setting  Goals 4-12.mp3, 7 min.]</p>
	  
      <p>In  this meeting, Denise is talking about when everyone is available and  for whatever they cannot get done, to email Denise by Saturday and <a class="tooltip">she will see if she can get it done instead.
        <span class="classic"><p> We see here that Denise is ready to pick up in the scenario where someone else in the team is not able to do the required work within the designated time. It was true leadership on Denise's part to offer to do that, and also to consider and plan for such a contingency. </p></span></a>
         She also describes  what needs to be made and to what degree and whether it works or not. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>After  the meeting, Denise compiles the goals, and posts a “to-do”  schedule:</p>

      <p>From:  Denise</p>
      <p>To:  crane-cs-l@mtu.edu, Hank</p>
      <p>Attached  is a zip of everything I have right now. Includes ported  compute_motor_rates.c, &nbsp;which I <a class="tooltip">hadn't sent out before.
          <span class="classic"><p> Denise, having established her supreme knowledge of the code beyond doubt, is at this point, very confident ad comfortable with 'tweaking' Bob's code. Although, in this case, it was requested by Bob in some measure. </p></span></a>
        I tweaked Bob's stuff in inv_kin_damping a little bit per his  comments; adding a for loop to copy Pi[] from Ps[], fixed his use of  vectormult (passing in the vectors by reference and modifying them in  the helper file rather than setting them to a returned value). About  the de-referencing (&quot;&gt; 132,135,and 156: Does the value need  to be dereferenced? &amp;&quot;) I dont know so I didn't change them  yet, I will look into it.</p>
