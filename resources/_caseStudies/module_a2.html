          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Bob,</p>
          <p>I'm  trying to get you folks accounts on our network. That way we could  meet anywhere in the MEEM. I need all three of your user ids to do  this. Let me know as soon as possible since there's a bit of a lag.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Thanks,</p>
          <p>Hank</p>
	    </div>
     
	 <p>The first meeting begins in Hank’s lab in the Mechanical Engineering (ME) building. Present are Hank (the client), and Computer Science (CS) Software Engineering Senior design students Denise, and Justin. Bob, the third CS team member, is absent. </p>
<p>Hank begins by showing the team Matlab, and talks about the tutorials available with the application. He then asks: “are there specific things [in Matlab] I can help you with?”</p>

<p>This is a partial transcript of the meeting. Some code specific parts of the discussion have been left out of the transcript and can be found in the audio file instead.</p>

<p>[common ground 2-1.mp3, 17 min]</p>

<div class="transcript">
  <BODY DIR="LTR">
  <p> Hank asks  about how the work of going through the Matlab tutorial was going.</p>
  <p> Hank: Did you  have tutorials and did you have a helpdesk? And they have tutorials  there.</p>
  <p> Denise: Well  we were going through the SIMULINK material and it has in some cases  things like Pull up this and do this. I am like are you sure that  there is somewhere it tells you what it means? We are getting closer  though.</p>
  <p> Hank: Well, I  can pull it up now but
      
    are there specific things I can help with in  terms of your understanding of Matlab, and the things that you need  to identify or know where you have trouble getting in.</p>
  <p> Denise: I was  having a little bit of trouble with the defining of the S functions  because they are very different from what we are used to, in terms of  static, dynamic. I was also trying to use the Automatic generator
      <!--  -->
    which I know. Basically, I was trying to  find </p>
  <p> Hank:
      <!--  -->
    Did you folks have that simulation example? That has a lot of S function examples in it. You can write  them in C or in as encoded S functions.</p>
  <p> [Some  description of what S functions really are and how Matlab and  Simulink uses an S function]</p>
  <p> Hank: Do you  folks have a numerical methods class? Or a class where you have  written simulation code or written and solves differential equations?</p>
  <p> Justin: I did  something like that in a Fortran class once but not a lot.</p>
  <p> Hank: Did you  try to use the code builder to generate code? </p>
  <p> [Hank then  goes on to describe exactly what commands to use while running S  functions written in C and shows them where to look for it in the  Helpdesk]</p>
  <p>
    <!--  -->
    Denise  describes the problem she had in choosing a compiler while running  the S functions, in terms of correct version of compiler to be  selected. Hank shows the CS team how to choose the compiler on the  machine in the ME lab, and describes how to choose parameters in  running the S-functions, and the differences amongst input, output  and parameters and how to check for them on Simulink using specific  keywords and commands. Also indicates which parts of the help  document will be useful. He then demonstrates how to write a Hello  World program and to run it, with detailed steps</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>Hank  talks about the big picture and also asks about Bob's absence.</p>
  <p>[big  picture 2-1.mp3, 11 min.]</p>

    <BODY DIR="LTR">
    <p> Hank: Pretty  soon, if Bob doesn't show, we could start talking about the big  picture a little bit. But before that, what is up with Bob?</p>
    <p> Justin:  (something indistinguishable)</p>
    <p>
      <!--  -->
      Denise: 
      <!--  -->
      Are we building a model like this or are we building one S function  or do
  <!--  -->
      we have it plug into a larger system? </p>
    <p> Hank:
        <!-- -->
      Yes, that is a pretty good question.
  <!-- -->
  <!-- -->
      Last semester, we kept trying to define how to  proceed, and I kept suggesting that we make a skeleton of the code,  and how I did that was by writing the names of the blocks and  what they did in the code. And that is the kind of thing I would hope  to happen here and how you want to organize the code. </p>
    <p> Denise: 
        <!-- -->
      So we've got to organize the code. I was thinking we would learn  Matlab first and then try to organize the code.</p>
    <p> Hank: And you  would want to do both learning Matlab and dissecting the code  simultaneously. Now learning Matlab will be the easy part and the fun  thing and there is documentation for it. Learning the code will be  kind of orthogonal and more challenging.</p>
    <p>
      <!--  -->
      Denise:  We are programmers, we are just dying to rip into the code.</p>
    <p> Hank:  Is that so? That's good. So the code has two main functions. I  can take about all the S-functions and put them in one of two bins.  One bin is like the Trash bin and the other bin is the stuff that  needs to get implemented as part of the architecture. I can do that  with a probability of success of what is useful of about 90%.
        <!-- . -->
      The reason I mention that is to show  that it is  not necessarily easy to discern that. There are some functions  in there which were written to support the hardware, like to read  data of a serial file and according to serial data communication so  packets were setup in a certain way.</p>
    <p> The reason we  don't need that code here is because we don't have that hardware.</p>
    <p>
      <!--  -->
      That  was a big road block last semester, that is getting the data into  these two bins. </p>
    <p> [Hank explains  more of how to understand the difference and use features of Simulink  to check each block of code and mask other functionality to determine  which bin each block of code would best go into. Hank also describes  a Simulink feature which helps mask functionality and make things  private and hidden from the user]</p>
    <p> Denise: We  want to do that because
        <!-- . -->
      we wont be supporting the code in the future.</p>
    <p> Hank(jokingly):  Well, this would be for a lifetime.</p>
    <p> Denise: Well,  some of us are going to graduate eventually.</p>
    <p> Hank: You  should try to mask things because it is helpful.</p>
    <p> Denise: Yeah,  if coders go in and change that later.</p>
    <p> Hank: You  folks can be really creative about it.... well anyway what will you  be doing</p>
    <p> Denise: Rip in  the code probably, do some of the skeletoning stuff, now we know what  we have to do.</p>
    <p> Hank:
        <!-- -->
     I would recommend a couple of things, since we just looked at  this Simulink stuff, you could play around with it while this is  still fresh in your minds and start going through the blocks and  start writing about things you dont think you need, and things you  think you need, maybe write a sentence each about the blocks. We  could meet next time and discuss it and
  <!-- -->
      I could tell you  whether you were close or not.  Or you could make a skeleton. It might be easier than directly making  the skeleton, If you want to make the skeleton, you could try that  but it might not be a super efficient use of your time. You could try  it if you want, I suppose, I mean the more background you have on  this the more help it will be.
  <!--  -->
      But I'll leave it up to you to decide. </p>
    <p> Denise: Do you  want to meet in one week or two weeks?</p>
    <p> Hank: I think  next week should be fine.
        <!--  -->
      Could you check if Bob can make it?</p>
    <p> Denise: We  will make sure that Bob is there.</p>
    <p><BR>
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <p>Hank expresses his concerns and expectations about team structure:</p>
<p>[Team Responsibility 2-1]</p>
<p>[The situation is that the team is meeting for the first time, and Bob has not showed up]</p>

  <BODY DIR="LTR">
  <p> Hank: How is  your team structured? Is there like a lead person or a point of  contact?</p>
  <p> Denise: Pretty  much anything to Bob.</p>
  <p> Hank: That is  just kind of a little concern. I mean, that is ok with me, certainly  I have no say in that. But
      <!--  -->
     you guys need to make sure that you are all on  board at the same level. I'll tell you what, I have office  hours and I like to make meetings with students. If they blow me off,  I let them have it, it gets brutal. I mean, I dont get abusive but I  take that pretty seriously, not just because my time is really  valuable, but it is an important thing to learn for the industry as  well, so if you blow off a meeting a couple of times you may get away  with it, but when the layoffs are coming, you would be a good  candidate. I think it is a really poor way to manage things.</p>
  <p> Denise:
      <!-- -->
    I apologize.</p>
  <p> Hank:
      <!--  -->
    No, it is not your fault, but I guess it is  something you guys can start talking about, you can do it in  the context of me being the bad guy or something, but I think it is  something you can talk about. Alright, so, thanks for coming by.</p>
  <p> Denise: Thanks  for your time, and we'll see you next week, hopefully with more  people.</p>

<p>Shortly after the meeting Bob sends this email, explaining his absence and promising to not have a slip up like that again:</p>

  <p>Subject:  Apoligize for missing meeting today.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Everyone,</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I  am very sorry for missing the meeting today. I feel like an ass  because I just sent an e-mail out yesterday to schedule this meeting.</p>
  <p>I  have been doing training for a local co-op early in the mornings and  I went home to take a nap for an hour or so and my my alarm clock  which has two modes was set for the wrong mode.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This  WILL NOT happen again.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Sorry,</p>

<p>And the next day, Denise posts the risk document to the rest of the team to share it with their coordinator, coach and faculty Dr. Dave Voelker:</p>

  <p>Here  is the first version of our project risk document. Most of the risks  were identified last semester, but new ones have been added. What  book were the specifications for the risk document taken out of,  since there is no documentation of what the Cause numbers mean?</p>

        <p>The first meeting begins in Hank’s lab in the Mechanical Engineering (ME) building. Present are Hank (the client), and Computer Science (CS) Software Engineering Senior design students Denise, and Justin. Bob, the third CS team member, is absent. </p>
        <p>Hank begins by showing the team Matlab, and talks about the tutorials available with the application. He then asks: “are there specific things [in Matlab] I can help you with?”</p>
        <p>This is a partial transcript of the meeting. Some code specific parts of the discussion have been left out of the transcript and can be found in the audio file instead.</p>

        <div class="transcript">
          <BODY DIR="LTR">
          <p> Hank asks  about how the work of going through the Matlab tutorial was going.</p>
          <p> Hank: Did you  have tutorials and did you have a helpdesk? And they have tutorials  there.</p>
          <p> Denise: Well  we were going through the SIMULINK material and it has in some cases  things like Pull up this and do this. I am like are you sure that  there is somewhere it tells you what it means? We are getting closer  though.</p>
          <p> Hank: Well, I  can pull it up now but
            
          <a class="tooltip">are there specific things<span class="classic">
          <p>Hank is carefully saying that he will be happy to help them with “specific” things, possibly in order to assess whether the team has been doing their homework, and is coming to him with valid questions. It may be because he is wary of being asked to explain the same things over and over, without the team then actually implementing it</p>
              </span></a> I can help with in  terms of your understanding of Matlab, and the things that you need  to identify or know where you have trouble getting in.
          </p>
          <p> Denise: I was  having a little bit of trouble with the defining of the S functions  because they are very different from what we are used to, in terms of  static, dynamic. I was also trying to use the Automatic generator
            <!--  -->
          <a class="tooltip">which I know. <span class="classic">
            <p>Denise, in her way was trying to assert that the team had looked at the material and made an honest effort, before asking for help.</p>
            </span></a>Basically, I was trying to  find
          </p>
          <p> Hank:
            <!--  -->
          <a class="tooltip">Did you folks have that simulation example?<span class="classic">
            <p>Hank is still searching for evidence that the team did the work they were asked to.</p>
            </span></a> That has a lot of S function examples in it. You can write  them in C or in as encoded S functions.
          </p>
          <p> [Some  description of what S functions really are and how Matlab and  Simulink uses an S function]</p>
          <p> Hank: Do you  folks have a numerical methods class? Or a class where you have  written simulation code or written and solves differential equations?</p>
          <p> Justin: I did  something like that in a Fortran class once but not a lot.</p>
          <p> Hank: Did you  try to use the code builder to generate code? </p>
          <p> [Hank then  goes on to describe exactly what commands to use while running S  functions written in C and shows them where to look for it in the  Helpdesk]</p>
          <p>
            <!--  -->
          <a class="tooltip"> Denise  describes the problem <span class="classic">
            <p>Denise, along with finally asking a focused question,in response to Hank's asserted expectation from the last few lines also establishes that she tried to actually run the simulation example</p>
            </span></a>she had in choosing a compiler while running  the S functions, in terms of correct version of compiler to be  selected. Hank shows the CS team how to choose the compiler on the  machine in the ME lab, and describes how to choose parameters in  running the S-functions, and the differences amongst input, output  and parameters and how to check for them on Simulink using specific  keywords and commands. Also indicates which parts of the help  document will be useful. He then demonstrates how to write a Hello  World program and to run it, with detailed steps

          <p> Hank: Pretty  soon, if Bob doesn't show, we could start talking about the big  picture a little bit. But before that, what is up with Bob?</p>

          <a class="tooltip"> Are we building a model like this <span class="classic">
            <p>Denise, probably having learned from her prior experience with Hank, asks a well structured question that indicates how keen she was to have things move towards an end-goal, while attempting to also understand what the end-goals are.</p>

          <!--  -->
          <a class="tooltip">we have it plug into a larger system?<span class="classic">
            <p>Comparison SI “Hank asked if we know how to go about the crane controller now, and Ken answered that he thinks we need to get more big picture, a flow chart, understand the terminology”    In SI, we notice that the team was often looking for a description of explanation of the big picture, as opposed to in SII, where even the identification of goals was being made with specifics in mind.    It possibly played to the SII Team's advantage that Denise was bringing this need to identify a goal up, instead of passively waiting for the big picture. To be described to you.</p>

            <p> Hank appreciates that he is being asked specific questions which indicate that Denise had given it some thought.</p>

          <a class="tooltip"> Last semester, <span class="classic">
            <p> A small reference to what Hank had hoped to accomplish the previous semester. </p>
            <p>What is probably happening here is that Hank is subtly describing what his expectation was from S1, about the code-breakdown, and the skeletal map and HE did some of that, instead of the team. And also that that is what he expects the S2 team to accomplish among other things.     Q: How confident from what has been said, would you as a S2 team member be of what expectations Hank may have of you. Was this clearly worded?</p>
            </span></a>we kept trying to define how to  proceed, and I kept suggesting that we make a skeleton of the code,  and how I did that was by writing the names of the blocks and  what they did in the code. And that is the kind of thing I would hope  to happen here and how you want to organize the code.
          </p>
          <p> Denise:
            <!-- -->
          <a class="tooltip">So we've got to organize the code. I was thinking we would learn <span class="classic">
            <p> Denise is confirming her understanding of what Hank is expecting of them.   She is also presenting her view of how she thought the team would work, that is Matlab learning first and then code breakdown.    Hank immediately expresses that the team will be working on both simultaneously.</p>
            </span></a> Matlab first and then try to organize the code.
          </p>
          <p> Hank: And you  would want to do both learning Matlab and dissecting the code  simultaneously. Now learning Matlab will be the easy part and the fun  thing and there is documentation for it. Learning the code will be  kind of orthogonal and more challenging.</p>
          <p>
            <!--  -->
            Denise:         
          <a class="tooltip"> We are programmers,<span class="classic">
            <p>Comparison with S1, When Denise states that they are dying to rip into the code, Hank appears quite pleased, which is probably because he still had apprehensions about whether any actual code-breakdown would get done, as he had hoped in S1, but had not been able to see.</p>
            </span></a> we are just dying to rip into the code.
          </p>
          <p> Hank:  Is that so? That's good. So the code has two main functions. I  can take about all the S-functions and put them in one of two bins.  One bin is like the Trash bin and the other bin is the stuff that  needs to get implemented as part of the architecture. I can do that  with a probability of success of what is useful of about 90%.

          <a class="tooltip">The reason I mention that is to show <span class="classic">
            <p>Here we can see Hank letting the students know that the bucketising is going to be challenging</p>
            </span></a> that it is  not necessarily easy to discern that. There are some functions  in there which were written to support the hardware, like to read  data of a serial file and according to serial data communication so  packets were setup in a certain way.
          </p>
          <p> The reason we  don't need that code here is because we don't have that hardware.</p>
          <p>
            <!--  -->
          <a class="tooltip"> That  was a big road block last semester,<span class="classic">
            <p>Here Hank is sharing what might be his disappointment with not having had the bucketizing done in Seabase I</p>
            </span></a> that is getting the data into  these two bins.
          </p>
          <p> [Hank explains  more of how to understand the difference and use features of Simulink  to check each block of code and mask other functionality to determine  which bin each block of code would best go into. Hank also describes  a Simulink feature which helps mask functionality and make things  private and hidden from the user]</p>
          <p> Denise: We  want to do that because

          <a class="tooltip">we wont be supporting<span class="classic">
            <p>Denise probably wants Hank to remember that the project was a short term commitment for the students.</p>

          </p>
          <p> Hank(jokingly):  Well, this would be for a lifetime.</p>
          <p> Denise: Well,  some of us are going to graduate eventually.</p>
          <p> Hank: You  should try to mask things because it is helpful.</p>
          <p> Denise: Yeah,  if coders go in and change that later.</p>
          <p> Hank: You  folks can be really creative about it.... well anyway what will you  be doing</p>
          <p> Denise: Rip in  the code probably, do some of the skeletoning stuff, now we know what  we have to do.</p>

            <p>Again, Hank is asserting that he thinks attendance of meetings is important, and that he would like the team to take it seriously. Denise appropriately reassures Hank that they will be on top of things, to let him know that the message is received.</p>

            <p>Even in the early stages, Hank wanted the team to know that he wants them to take the project seriously</p>
            </span></a> need to make sure that you are all on  board at the same level. I'll tell you what, I have office  hours and I like to make meetings with students. If they blow me off,  I let them have it, it gets brutal. I mean, I dont get abusive but I  take that pretty seriously, not just because my time is really  valuable, but it is an important thing to learn for the industry as  well, so if you blow off a meeting a couple of times you may get away  with it, but when the layoffs are coming, you would be a good  candidate. I think it is a really poor way to manage things.

            <p> Denise attempts to assure Hank that she has understood the severity of what he is trying to convey and that the team takes responsibility for their actions.</p>

          <p> Hank:
            <!--  -->
          <a class="tooltip"> No, it is not your fault, <span class="classic">
            <p>Hank changes his stance slightly, perhaps having realized that he may have come down a little too hard, and tells them he is not assigning blame, but is just making sure that group structure is kept in mind.</p>
            </span></a>but I guess it is  something you guys can start talking about, you can do it in  the context of me being the bad guy or something, but I think it is  something you can talk about. Alright, so, thanks for coming by.
          </p>
          <p> Denise: Thanks  for your time, and we'll see you next week, hopefully with more  people.</p>

        <p>Shortly after the meeting Bob sends this email, explaining his absence and promising to not have a slip up like that again:</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Everyone,</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>I  am very sorry for missing the meeting today. I feel like an ass  because I just sent an e-mail out yesterday to schedule this meeting.</p>
          <p>I  have been doing training for a local co-op early in the mornings and  I went home to take a nap for an hour or so and my my alarm clock  which has two modes was set for the wrong mode.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>This  WILL NOT happen again.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Sorry,</p>
          <p>-Bob</p>

        <p>And the next day, Denise posts the risk document to the rest of the team to share it with their coordinator, coach and faculty Dr. Dave Voelker:</p>

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Here  is the first version of our project risk document. Most of the risks  were identified last semester, but new ones have been added. What  book were the specifications for the risk document taken out of,  since there is no documentation of what the Cause numbers mean?</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Thank  you</p>
          <p>Crane  Team!</p>
