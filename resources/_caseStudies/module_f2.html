      <p>This  meeting was held in a computer lab in Rekhi Hall, and the recording  quality was less than optimal. But you can listen in, and hear the  team discuss their questions of what Hank wants:</p>
      <p>[Client  Wants 3-24.mp3, 2 min.]</p>
      
	  <p>There  is some discussion within the team about why new code is needed and  why the old code cannot be used more extensively.<BR>
      </p>
      <p>And  who on the team will be responsible for which tasks:</p>

        Denise  suggests that they start making code, there is some discussion  over the presence of static variables and their behavior within the  existing code. The team decides when to meet next as suggested by  Denise.</p>
      <p>Then  after the meeting Bob sends out the final draft of the presentation:</p>

      <p>Subject:  Meeting tomorrow</p>
      <p>Hey  guys,</p>
      <p>I  just found out I have an interview tomorrow at noon, so I won't be  able to make the meeting.&nbsp; I'm still going through exactly what  we can do with the .H files.</p>
      <p>-Justin</p>
	  </div>
      <p>During  the meeting on the 29th, Hank again checks the teams  progress on Matlab, as well as the difficulty in getting a response  from the ME team:</p>
      <p>[Checking  Progress 3-29.mp3, 16 min.]</p>
	  
	  <div class="transcript">
      <p> Hank:
          <!-- Hank breifly checking, perhaps about attendance again. -->
        Is everyone here that is going to be here? What happened?</p>
      <p> Bob:
          <!-- Bob takes initiative and starts with his update, however, there is a difference in the clarity and depth to which Bob gives his update, compared to Denise. -->
        Well, I played with the globals a little bit.  I can define them in the workspace, and then I tried to use them in a  block and it says it cannot allow that. Then I played with the .hs a  little bit, and created like an int, but it says upsert value 1. I  dont know if it allows the .hs to do that. It is saying it couldn't  run it in the loop. Something about configuration cranberes.</p>
      <p> Hank:
          <!-- Hank trying to arrive at the details of the issue, having received a vague description. -->
        Are you saying you could run that or something?  Or wouldnt let you do that or something.</p>
      <p> Justin: It  says something about ...(list of codes here).. and then an ss error.</p>
      <p> Hank: You dont  have like a continuous state.. or something like that.
          <!-- It seems like Hank is trying to direct the discussion to something more constructive. Denise notices Hank's impatience, and steps in with an answer, which is precise and adequately descriptive. -->
        Well the last time we met, we divided up things  to do, and I cant remember who was supposed to do what.</p>
      <p> Denise: Well  the last time we met, Justin was supposed to look at the .h  files and </p>
      <p> And me and him  both wrote down stuff in the control functions and normal functions.  We are going to move them all into input shaping, and then only pass  the things that are needed into inverse kinematics.</p>
      <p> Hank:  Certainly some of those variables are not even ever used in input  shaping.</p>
      <p> Denise: yeah,  we … some aren't used at all. But we thought we would have the  values set and pass only the ones that are needed.</p>
      <p> Hank: I see  what you are trying to do but..I think... what about the notion of  having another S function which initializes those things , sets them  and distributes them</p>
      <p> Denise: We are  just trying to minimize s functions and passing.</p>
      <p> Hank: Cause  later if someone is looking at this stuff, they wouldn't know what  those functions are really doing.</p>
      <p> Denise:  Right... Ok, cause that is how we had originally decided, Stuff to  initialize input shaping and schematics. This is how we have it  broken down now and we cannot basically change it.</p>
      <p> Hank: Yeah,  well I think you need to get more a description at least between the  2 of them. Your solution to it is fine, but … the data and signals  have to flow. If times going this way, and under one move you want  the flow to go like this, and another move the line would move this  way.</p>
      <p> Denise: We  were thinking about dividing it up into 2 blocks and have a flag  between the two.</p>
      <p> Hank: Well,  that could also be a problem, cause the output of damping needs to go  into the damping. And the output of one needs to go into another, and  how will you distinguish about which ones to use.</p>
      <p>
        <!-- There is an exchange of ideas, where Hank is examining the team's plans as presented by Denise. Hank has some ideas about how he wants the work to be done, which Denise finally concedes to, even though it appears that the team may have to do some rework now. -->
        It  just doesn't seem very clean.</p>
      <p> Denise: So 1  would be damping and 2 would be inverse kinematics.</p>
      <p> Hank:  this way the lines are clean and when there is a delay, it  knows what to do and take which data at one time step delay.</p>
      <p> (more  discussion on code) </p>
      <p>The  process is helped along by using a drawing Denise created:</p>
      <p>[Crane  2\Crane 2 Drawings\Drawing3-29.pdf]</p>
      <p>And  you can hear Denise getting more assertive:</p>
      <p>[Asserting  3-29.mp3, 13 min.]</p>
      <p>Denise  asserts her idea of what to move into input shaping and says that  damping and input shaping should be done in a certain way, She  suggests that they move damping schematics into 'input shaping'</p>
      <p>Hank  says that he can see what they are saying and s
          <!-- At this point in the discussion, you see a change from the last difference of opinion, where Denise conceded to following Hank's plans after stating her case. This time Denise stands her ground, and Hank then changes his suggestion. -->
        uggests  having another S function which does that?</p>
      <p>Denise  says that they wanted to minimize S functions.</p>
      <p>Hank  suggests using a vector as a parameter in the S functions.</p>
      <p>[this  is an excerpt of another transcript]</p>
      <p>
        <!-- Part of this excerpt is repeated from a previous conversation excerpt. -->
        Denise:  Well the last time we met, Justin was supposed to look at the .h  files and </p>
      <p> And me and him  both wrote down stuff in the control functions and normal functions.  We are going to move them all into input shaping, and then only pass  the things that are needed into inverse kinematics.</p>

      <p> Hank: How  about using a vector as a parameter in the S functions.<BR>
      </p>
      <p>Denise  says that they dont want to compile anything in CFG</p>
      <p>Denise  talks about init section</p>
      <p>they  do not want to use the init part of the init function and move it  into other places.</p>
      <p>Hank  says that is fine but to be careful of the flow, and also we need to  be able to switch between modes.</p>
      <p>Hank  tries running input shape code of different types.</p>

      <p>Can  you guys please look at it and let me know if I need to add anything.  We can touch it up tomorrow at our meeting if it's nothing too  important.</p>

      <p>This  meeting was held in a computer lab in Rekhi Hall, and the recording  quality was less than optimal. But you can listen in, and hear the  team discuss their questions of what Hank wants:</p>
      <p>[Client  Wants 3-24.mp3, 2 min.]</p>
      
	  <p>There  is some discussion within the team about why new code is needed and  why the old code cannot be used more extensively.<BR>
      </p>
      <p>And  who on the team will be responsible for which tasks:</p>

        <a class="tooltip">Denise  suggests<span class="classic"><p> Denise clearly in charge of what direction the team takes. </p></span></a> that they start making code, there is some discussion  over the presence of static variables and their behavior within the  existing code. The team decides when to meet next as suggested by  Denise.</p>
      <p>Then  after the meeting Bob sends out the final draft of the presentation:</p>

      <p>Subject:  Meeting tomorrow</p>
      <p>Hey  guys,</p>
      <p>I  just found out I have an interview tomorrow at noon, so I won't be  able to make the meeting.&nbsp; I'm still going through exactly what  we can do with the .H files.</p>
      <p>-Justin</p>

      <p>During  the meeting on the 29th, Hank again checks the teams  progress on Matlab, as well as the difficulty in getting a response  from the ME team:</p>
      <p>[Checking  Progress 3-29.mp3, 16 min.]</p>
	  
	  <div class="transcript">
      <p> Hank:
          <!-- Hank breifly checking, perhaps about attendance again. -->
        Is everyone here that is going to be here? What happened?</p>
      <p> Bob:
          <!-- Bob takes initiative and starts with his update, however, there is a difference in the clarity and depth to which Bob gives his update, compared to Denise. -->
        Well, I played with the globals a little bit.  I can define them in the workspace, and then I tried to use them in a  block and it says it cannot allow that. Then I played with the .hs a  little bit, and created like an int, but it says upsert value 1. I  dont know if it allows the .hs to do that. It is saying it couldn't  run it in the loop. Something about configuration cranberes.</p>
      <p> Hank:
          <!-- Hank trying to arrive at the details of the issue, having received a vague description. -->
        Are you saying you could run that or something?  Or wouldnt let you do that or something.</p>
      <p> Justin: It  says something about ...(list of codes here).. and then an ss error.</p>
      <p> Hank: You dont  have like a continuous state.. or something like that.
          <!-- It seems like Hank is trying to direct the discussion to something more constructive. Denise notices Hank's impatience, and steps in with an answer, which is precise and adequately descriptive. -->
        Well the last time we met, we divided up things  to do, and I cant remember who was supposed to do what.</p>
      <p> Denise: Well  the last time we met, Justin was supposed to look at the .h  files and </p>
      <p> And me and him  both wrote down stuff in the control functions and normal functions.  We are going to move them all into input shaping, and then only pass  the things that are needed into inverse kinematics.</p>
      <p> Hank:  Certainly some of those variables are not even ever used in input  shaping.</p>
      <p> Denise: yeah,  we … some aren't used at all. But we thought we would have the  values set and pass only the ones that are needed.</p>
      <p> Hank: I see  what you are trying to do but..I think... what about the notion of  having another S function which initializes those things , sets them  and distributes them</p>
      <p> Denise: We are  just trying to minimize s functions and passing.</p>
      <p> Hank: Cause  later if someone is looking at this stuff, they wouldn't know what  those functions are really doing.</p>
      <p> Denise:  Right... Ok, cause that is how we had originally decided, Stuff to  initialize input shaping and schematics. This is how we have it  broken down now and we cannot basically change it.</p>
      <p> Hank: Yeah,  well I think you need to get more a description at least between the  2 of them. Your solution to it is fine, but … the data and signals  have to flow. If times going this way, and under one move you want  the flow to go like this, and another move the line would move this  way.</p>
      <p> Denise: We  were thinking about dividing it up into 2 blocks and have a flag  between the two.</p>
      <p> Hank: Well,  that could also be a problem, cause the output of damping needs to go  into the damping. And the output of one needs to go into another, and  how will you distinguish about which ones to use.</p>
      <p>
        <!-- There is an exchange of ideas, where Hank is examining the team's plans as presented by Denise. Hank has some ideas about how he wants the work to be done, which Denise finally concedes to, even though it appears that the team may have to do some rework now. -->
        It  just doesn't seem very clean.</p>
      <p> Denise: So 1  would be damping and 2 would be inverse kinematics.</p>
      <p> Hank:  this way the lines are clean and when there is a delay, it  knows what to do and take which data at one time step delay.</p>
      <p> (more  discussion on code) </p>
      <p>The  process is helped along by using a drawing Denise created:</p>
      <p>[Crane  2\Crane 2 Drawings\Drawing3-29.pdf]</p>
      <p>And  you can hear Denise getting more assertive:</p>
      <p>[Asserting  3-29.mp3, 13 min.]</p>
      <p>Denise  asserts her idea of what to move into input shaping and says that  damping and input shaping should be done in a certain way, She  suggests that they move damping schematics into 'input shaping'</p>
      <p>Hank  says that he can see what they are saying and s
          <!-- At this point in the discussion, you see a change from the last difference of opinion, where Denise conceded to following Hank's plans after stating her case. This time Denise stands her ground, and Hank then changes his suggestion. -->
        uggests  having another S function which does that?</p>
      <p>Denise  says that they wanted to minimize S functions.</p>
      <p>Hank  suggests using a vector as a parameter in the S functions.</p>
      <p>[this  is an excerpt of another transcript]</p>
      <p>
        <!-- Part of this excerpt is repeated from a previous conversation excerpt. -->
        Denise:  Well the last time we met, Justin was supposed to look at the .h  files and </p>

      <p> Hank: How  about using a vector as a parameter in the S functions.<BR>
      </p>
      <p>Denise  says that they dont want to compile anything in CFG</p>
      <p>Denise  talks about init section</p>
      <p>they  do not want to use the init part of the init function and move it  into other places.</p>
      <p>Hank  says that is fine but to be careful of the flow, and also we need to  be able to switch between modes.</p>
      <p>Hank  tries running input shape code of different types.</p>
