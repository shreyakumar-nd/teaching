  <p><U><strong>Examples  of Strategic Patterns</strong></U></p>
  <p><U><strong>Pattern:</strong></U></p>
  <p><em><strong>Meeting Minutes</strong></em></p>
  <p><strong>Brief  Description: </strong> </p>
  <p>Meeting  Minutes are supposed to capture what is discussed and decided in a  particular meeting, usually by a designated attendee, and are meant  for all attendees and other people from the project to keep track of  progress and decisions, for purposes of maintaining accountability,  monitoring and record keeping.</p>
  <p><strong>WHAT</strong> The decision to take notes for all meetings as the responsibility of  one of the team members, and communicating that to the rest of the  members concerned regularly. The artifact of communication in this  case are the meeting minutes. It can be considered a written history  of conversation, perhaps not word for word.</p>
  <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>WHERE </strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> The  	meeting minutes pattern normally occurs during regularly scheduled  	meetings or ad hoc meetings, either in person or over tele or video  	conferencing. Minutes can be taken at any meeting, but are normally  	taken in formal, multi-party meetings, which may of a slightly  	formal nature. </LI>
    <LI> Minutes  	are not usually taken at meetings of the form of directed  	presentations or brainstorming sessions. They are considered more  	useful for meetings where some sort of decision making or task  	allocation or progress update is discussed.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>WHO </strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> Usually  	one person, the designated Point of Contact or Scribe would be  	responsible to take down the meeting minutes. </LI>
    <LI> The  	attendees of the meeting, among other people at managerial posts are  	the intended audience for the meeting minutes. </LI>
    <LI> The  	meetings are meant for internal consumption and are not the type of  	communication artifact that would be publicly available.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Style:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>HOW</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> The  	style of this communication pattern is formal. </LI>
    <LI> The  	level of detail captured in the meeting minutes would vary depending  	on the need from attendees or just what is an agreed-to level of  	granularity. Minutes can be as detailed as a transcript of the  	entire conversation, which in most cases would seem unnecessary, or  	just capturing the main action points that emerged in the meeting as  	they would be the only relevant decisions that would be useful at a  	later time, like the next meeting.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
  <p><strong>WHY</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> The  	management goal of having a designated point of contact keeping the  	communication streamlined and consistent, and having a record of all  	communication and decisions for reference. </LI>
    <LI> It  	facilitates better team management. Within this management pattern,  	there exist different communication patterns associated with the  	point of contact. Meeting minutes are one of them.</LI>
    <LI> Minutes  	can serve as a means of keeping track of attendance and  	participation. Some managers might find this a useful tool.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Benefits  Analysis:</strong></p>
  <UL>
    <LI> All  	the discussions, and decisions of all meetings are saved for record  	keeping purposes, to learn from, resolve communication discrepancies  	later, to allow non-attendees to catch up and to remind everyone of  	the state of the discussion.</LI>
    <LI> Also,  	as a point of contact keeps the meeting minutes, it is a good chance  	that the scribe would not be actively participating as much as the  	team members talking but would be paying attention through all of  	it. </LI>
    <LI> As  	one person is the scribe, all the communication would tend to be  	consistent and follow the same type of style, depth and structure.</LI>
    <LI> If  	participants know that the communication is being recorded in some  	form, they feel the need to participate more actively, as one would  	under observation. In some cases, it encourages participation.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Risks:</strong></p>
  <UL>
    <LI> The  	risks associated with taking meeting minutes is that more often than  	not, no one reads them. </LI>
    <LI> In  	the absence of their eventual use, they might be considered a waste  	of time and resources. </LI>
    <LI> Also,  	the decision to keep meeting minutes might often be associated with  	following the norm as opposed to actually acknowledging its benefits  	and accordingly wanting to use it.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><U><strong>Example:</strong></U></p>
  <p>JoAnn  was designated the point of contact in the Seabase I project, her  responsibilities included taking notes for all meetings, informing  everyone of progress, keeping her team members up-to-date with any  communication or decisions.</p>
  <p>Contrarily,  Seabase II did not have a strategically designated point of contact,  however Denise did start performing that role to some extent. As in  Seabase II, it was not a strategic move, it can be considered a  tactical pattern and is described in that section.</p>
  <p><U><strong>Pattern:</strong></U></p>
  <p><em><strong>Stakeholder team meetings</strong></em></p>
  <p><strong>Brief  Description:</strong></p>
  <p>A  stakeholder meeting is usually a formal meeting of all or most  important and interested stakeholders. It can be called for several  different reasons </p>
  <p><strong>Types  of stakeholder meetings:</strong></p>
  <UL>
    <LI> Demo/Prototype  	presentation – This type of meeting involves the stakeholders so  	that they can assess and review design or progress. </LI>
    <LI> Information  	Solicitation - This type of meeting may involve the stakeholders for  	different reasons. Either because the project team needs to solicit  	information, like requirements from the stakeholders, or because the  	stakeholders want to be involved in information solicitation from an  	important third party.</LI>
    <LI> Decision  	making/Project Planning – This type of meeting involves the  	stakeholders because any major decisions on the project may affect  	the stakeholder's interests.</LI>
    <LI> Brainstorming  	session – On rare occasions, stakeholders may be involved in  	brainstorming sessions to solve problems or resolve burning issues,  	which may affect the project delivery.</LI>
    <BR>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Brief  Description : </strong> </p>
  <p>In  projects where the stakeholders wish to maintain tight control of the  progress or to define scope actively, frequent stakeholder meetings  may be called for taking major decisions, specially those that would  affect multiple teams/parties. This could also be the pattern close  to product delivery or launch when important decisions need to be  taken.</p>
  <p><strong>WHAT</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> Team  	member and stakeholder meetings are held frequently to be able to  	discuss and review the project scope regularly and make decisions.  	All affected and interested stakeholders are encouraged to  	participate. </LI>
    <LI> This  	type of communication pattern may be centered around artifacts like  	project scope or progress plan or projected returns plan. Usually  	these artifacts are accompanied by a meeting agenda, which might  	include reviewing the project plan, etc.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Context  :</strong></p>
  <p><strong>WHERE</strong></p>
  <UL>
    <LI> This  	form of communication is applicable where there is active  	stakeholder involvement and willingness to meet and make decisions. </LI>
    <LI> It  	is almost necessary where the scope of the project is left flexibly  	defined or when decisions need to be confirmed or reviewed close to  	launch and more so where the project type is such that market trends  	might affect launch enormously. </LI>
    <LI> Frequent  	stakeholder meetings can be considered useful during the delivery  	phase of large projects as well, when certain critical time line  	based decisions may need to be taken, or final consent may be needed  	to take market delivery based decisions. </LI>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>WHO</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> Stakeholders  	and either all team members or at least a representatives from each  	team are typical participants. </LI>
    <LI> Often,  	small teams may have no representation in stakeholder meetings if  	they don't have any say in the decision making process, depending on  	the model of organization</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Style  :</strong></p>
  <p><strong>HOW</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> The  	style of communication is very formal. Meetings with stakeholder  	involvement tend to be agenda driven. As stakeholders are usually  	people in upper management, they tend to also be people who are  	usually busy, therefore having a prepared agenda is the norm in  	those meetings.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Goals  : </strong> </p>
  <p><strong>WHY</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> The  	goals of deciding to have stakeholder meetings frequently have to do  	with closely observing progress and team abilities and consider  	delivery time lines and prioritize requirements, in the initial  	phases of the project. </LI>
    <LI> This  	allows for good change management, specially where market factors  	affect delivery and active stakeholder involvement may be considered  	beneficial.</LI>
    <LI> If  	in the beginning, the number of stakeholders is large or if the  	exact nature and scope of the work is not clear, and project members  	know that changes in cope can be expected, then to rigidly define  	the scope and work off of it is not considered prudent, and it is  	accepted that the scope of the project will be flexibly defined,  	with room to accommodate new requirements or even completely  	different work related to the same project, later.</LI>
    <LI> Sometimes  	this is done so that the client can evaluate the team's performance  	on part of the work, and if suitably impressed, later decide to  	assign more work to them. The decision to meet frequently is to  	affect identifying changes in scope quickly. Also taking notes  	during meetings and sharing that with others may be decided based on  	availability of involved stakeholders.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Benefits  Analysis : </strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> Flexible  	scope management can be tricky. As good time management is dependent  	on knowing beforehand the amount and complexity of the work to be  	undertaken. When the scope of the work is left not clearly defined,  	then to factor how much time it should take to do the amount of work  	becomes difficult. Also, if the scope is not clear, it may become  	difficult to focus and prioritize work.</li>
    <LI> Considering  	the volatile nature of requirements, specially in the software  	engineering field, it is usually beneficial to keep scope flexibly  	defined, but being careful of still being able to prioritize, even  	in the absence of all the requirements. </li>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Risks  :</strong></p>
  <UL>
    <LI> Having  	meetings more frequently does not guarantee more decisions being  	made. Sometimes a communication pattern is noticed where meetings  	are not very effective. A lot of discussion takes place along with  	exchange of ideas, but no real decisions get made and the next  	meeting follows the same pattern where ideas are discussed, but no  	tangible action is taken.</li>
    <LI> As  	the stakeholders will tend to come from different teams or  	management positions and may have different goals to meet  	individually using the project, it may sometimes be difficult to  	reach consensus on decisions, specially when a compromise or more  	has to be made.</li>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p>Seabase  I where in the end of October, the team realized that they have to do  design in MATLAB in addition to porting the code from C. Scope change  or change in expectations.</p>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><U><strong>Pattern:</strong></U></p>
  <p>Another  management pattern is adding intangible goals like “Get familiar  with software/language/domain”. (Seabase I and II) </p>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><em><strong> Frequent team meetings with constant agenda</strong></em></p>
  <p><strong>Brief  Description : </strong> </p>
  <p>Internal  team meetings may be called often to either discuss points of  interest and decide on a micro level next steps for everyday working  or simply to designate time to just get the assigned work done. These  may be sub-team meetings if the actual team size is large.</p>
  <p><strong>WHAT</strong> This pattern has to do with communication as frequent internal team  meetings. They may be scheduled regularly or ad hoc. </p>
  <p><strong>Context  : </strong> </p>
  <p><strong>WHEN</strong> This type pf meeting is usually held face to face and difficult to  implement as often in teams that are not co-located, as ad hoc  scheduling may be difficult.<BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>WHO</strong> The entire internal team or suitable sub-team would typically meet.</p>
  <p><strong>Style  : </strong> </p>
  <p><strong>HOW</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> This  	type of meeting is usually in the form of a learning –  	brainstorming session where a soft goal like learning the technology  	is pursued. </LI>
    <LI> These  	meetings are usually characterized by the absence of a constantly  	changing agenda. The agenda may be as simple as designating daily  	tasks to team members or to discuss minor roadblocks. They are  	usually held to comply with a rolling goal. The degree to which the  	meeting agenda is constant is dependent on whether the soft goal has  	work products associated with it. </LI>
    <LI> This  	type of meeting would typically not use meeting minutes to record  	communication, specially if the team is small. For larger teams,  	this type of meeting may still use some form of agenda or task  	tracking mechanism, like meeting minutes.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Goals  : </strong> </p>
  <p><strong>WHY</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> These  	type of meetings are usually held to allow the team to use their  	collective intellect and abilities. </li>
    <LI> These  	meetings meet generically defined goals which are expected to take  	time to complete, like extensive system design, learning a new  	technology, etc.</li>
    <LI> These  	meeting may be useful for leads of small teams to manage the  	everyday working of the team, and ensure that all members are making  	progress to meet larger task requirements.</li>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Benefits  Analysis : </strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> These  	type of meetings are helpful in allowing the team members to share  	what they have learned and improve their understanding by reflecting  	ideas off one another. </li>
    <LI> Also,  	it allows for each team member to spend dedicated time working  	towards a goal. It is often observed that team members feel more  	motivated to work when there are frequent meetings being held and  	they feel like there is ongoing work.</li>
    <LI> This  	type of communication pattern can be improved upon by perhaps  	meeting just as often, but also by setting milestones and including  	work products, like progress reports or analysis charts, etc.</li>
    <LI> Meeting  	often becomes a pattern that is followed as it usually gives  	everyone a sense of forward momentum because something is happening. </li>
    <BR>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Risks  : </strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> As  	no tangible result is decided upon in most cases, meetings may  	revolve around discussing what should or has been learned, but in  	the absence of a target to achieve, teams have trouble assessing  	progress, or deciding on pace. </li>
    <LI> Some  	team members may find frequent internal meetings a waste of their  	time, specially if they already have a clear idea of what is  	expected of them and how to get it done.</li>
    <BR>
  </UL>
  <p><U><strong>Pattern:</strong></U></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><em><strong> Daily Update meeting</strong></em><BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brief  Description : </strong> </p>
  <p>A  quick daily internal team meeting is held just as a means to elicit  progress update from each of the team members, and to decide if  further meetings in the day are required to deal with issues.</p>
  <p> <strong>WHAT</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> A daily stand up update meeting is  	an example of a strategic communication pattern. In this meeting,  	the team members all stand in a circle and one by one, each one  	gives a short update of the progress that has been made since the  	previous day or the issues identified. Each member has to speak, and  	has to keep it short. </li>
    <LI> The communication artifact here is  	abstract here, and just the simple medium of speech is used.  	Typically minutes or notes would not be taken.</li>
    <BR>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Context  : </strong> </p>
  <p><strong>WHEN</strong> Daily team update meetings are usually conducted where teams are co  located, and there are strict time lines to adhere to, thereby the  need for more active monitoring of progress or lack thereof.</p>
  <p><strong>WHO </strong>Entire internal team. Either the team would have a manager or  would be a self managed team. As the communication artifact here is  speech, it is typically meant for the manager(if any) to hear.</p>
  <p><strong>Style  : </strong> </p>
  <p> <strong>HOW</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> The style of the meeting is  	intentionally kept very informal, with no communication record  	keeping involved. </li>
    <LI> This type of daily update stand up  	meeting is a pattern that is followed to have very frequent updates,  	without taking up a lot of unnecessary time of the team members. It  	is also a means for the entire team to meet and identify any major  	issues that might need attention. </li>
    <LI> Everyone is asked to stand during  	the meeting to prevent the meeting for dragging on too long, and  	standing gives everyone incentive to be quick and end the meeting  	soon.</li>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Goals  : </strong> </p>
  <p><strong>WHY</strong> The major goal of conducting daily team meetings is to track and  encourage progress. </p>

    <LI> As everyone is expected to speak,  	most team members feels obliged to have made some progress to have  	something to report, perhaps to save themselves from the  	embarrassment of not having a proper update. </li>
    <LI> Any issues that are identified in  	the team can be appropriately prioritized within a day and if  	necessary, a follow up meeting can be organized only with concerned  	members to decide whether more attention and resources need to be  	diverted to the issue.</li>
    <LI> The stand-up meeting helps the team  	stay focused and alert, and everyone in the team gets an idea of how  	the other parts of the project are coming along.</li>
    <LI> As  	everyone is kept standing, each member is usually conscious of not  	giving unnecessarily long updates for the sake of not keeping  	everyone standing uncomfortably for long. </li>

  <p><strong>Risks  : </strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> Some  	team members might consider it an unnecessary waste of time to meet  	every morning.</li>
    <LI> And  	the meetings might seem to feel repetitive during phases of low  	progress or low activity.</li>
    <LI> Sometimes,  	enforcing attendance for daily meetings becomes an issue, specially  	in teams that operate during different hours and/or are remotely  	located.</li>

  <p>A daily stand up update meeting as  part of SCRUM is an example of a strategic communication pattern. In  this meeting, the team members all stand in a circle and one by one,  each one gives a short update of the progress that has been made  since the previous day or the issues identified. Each member has to  speak, and has to keep it short. </p>

  <p><U><strong>Pattern:  Visualization</strong></U></p>
  <p><strong>Brief  Description:</strong></p>
  <p> Wanting to see a flow chart  representation of complicated data relationships or complex software  code. </p>
  <p><strong>Benefits  Analysis:</strong></p>
  <UL>
    <LI> As a tactical move, team members  	realize that a complicated component relationship and workflow may  	be better understood through a flowchart or a block diagram of some  	sort. In many projects, even though it may not be part of the  	original strategic plan, the advantage of having a visual  	representation of the existing system or the system to be built is  	realized and ad-hoc demands for such forms of visual representation  	are made.</LI>
    <LI> Sometimes, just the process of  	making the visualization artifact is good enough to lend  	understanding of the system, in addition to the finished artifact  	serving as a means to enhance understanding.</LI>
    <LI> As a tactical move in increasing  	the understanding of the system to be built, the demand for visual  	representations is usually a fruitful move, provided the visual  	representation produced is effective.</LI>
    <LI> All members can potentially have  	different, even conflicting views of the design, which may not be  	evident from the written or verbal form of design representation.</LI>
    <LI> This type of visual representation  	helps in bridging any disparities or gap in understanding and brings  	everyone involved to effectively the same level of understanding.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
      <strong>Risks:</strong></p>
  <UL>
    <LI> If the visual representation is too  	vague however, it may confuse some folks, or generate discussion and  	an opportunity for things to become clear.</LI>
    <LI> Some team members may believe  	generating multiple visualizations of the system may be a waste of  	time and resources, specially if they already understand the system.</LI>

  <p><U><strong>Collaborative Learning</strong></U></p>
  <p><strong>Brief  Description:</strong></p>
  <p> Understanding difficult concepts as  a team. A team meeting with a purpose to learn together is held as  part of this pattern.</p>
  <p><strong>WHO</strong> The internal team, specially team  members working on similar tasks.</p>
  <p><strong>Style:</strong></p>
  <p> This type of meeting is an open  forum. All members are encouraged to participate and share their  views. The tone is informal, and meeting minutes may not be taken,  unless the team decides there is benefit in taking notes.</p>
  <p><strong>HOW </strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> One team member may open the  	discussion by speaking of their gap in understanding and what they  	hope to accomplish from the meeting. </LI>
    <LI> Alternatively, there might be an  	informally written agenda, which may be in the form of just the main  	topics, or a collection of doubts/queries that the meeting is called  	to resolve.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Benefits  Analysis:</strong></p>
  <UL>
    <LI> Team members would individually  	have different strengths when it comes to grasping different types  	of concepts. Some folks may understand code very easily, some folks  	may understand concepts of physics better. At any stage, if the team  	decides to use discussion as a means to enhance understanding, this  	can be considered as a tactical move, if it was not already part of  	the plan.</LI>
    <LI> Such discussion allow for all  	members to share their understanding of the work at hand, and this  	exchange of ideas usually allows for everyone to be on the same page  	about functionality, about concepts being implemented, and the  	expectations of them. </LI>
    <LI> It is usually found that group  	discussions are an efficient way to enhance understanding and reach  	decisions, ensure everyone is on track, keep everyone interested and  	motivated.</LI>

  </OL>
  <p><U><strong>Pattern:  Storytelling</strong></U></p>
  <p>Storytelling  is a tactic employed by many different roles in the project,  specially by those in managerial positions, and can serve many  different purposes, depending on the way it is implemented. The basic  principle behind it is to tell a story, either casually, in  conversation, or explicitly as a story of importance, and is intended  for the audience to receive a message as a result of the storytelling  process.<BR>
  </p>
  <p>Different  types of stories:</p>
  <p><BR>
      <U><strong>Story Type : </strong></U></p>
  <p><U><strong>The  Cautionary Tale</strong></U></p>
  <p><strong>Brief  Description:</strong></p>
  <p>This  type of story is told to advise the audience to be careful of  specific types of behavior.<BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>WHAT:</strong></p>
  <p>The  communication artifact here is the story. It is an aural artifact.  Sometimes the story is modified to stress the message.<BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Style(HOW):</strong></p>
  <p>Depending  on what it intended, it may be as mild as general advice, or as  severe as a warning. It is a good way to set expectations and at the  same time express the consequences of the expectation not being met,  or the expected behavior not being followed. The style is usually  informal/casual. And the message is implicit.<BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>WHO:</strong></p>
  <p>Cautionary  Tales are usually told by a manager or a stakeholder, like the  client, and are typically intended for the project team. </p>
  <p><strong>WHEN:</strong></p>
  <UL>
    <LI> The  	pattern for telling the Cautionary Tale may be invoked ad hoc as the  	need arises, or when the message is appropriate. </LI>
    <LI> Some  	managers may tell the cautionary tale in the beginning of the  	project to let the team members know that the message is to be taken  	seriously. </LI>
    <LI> Sometimes  	the pattern is invoked when a similar situation as the story speaks  	of is likely to occur, or is already happening.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><BR>
      <U><strong>Story Type: </strong></U></p>
  <p><em><U><strong>The  Comparison</strong></U></em></p>
  <p><strong>Brief  Description:</strong></p>
  <p>The  comparison tale is a story that is told to compare the behavior of  the current team with another team, perhaps on the same or some other  project. The motivation for comparison can be appreciation or  criticism.</p>
  <p><strong>HOW(Style):</strong></p>
  <p>This  type of story is also told informally. The message in the Comparison  Tale is usually more apparent and less implied.</p>
  <p><strong>WHO:</strong></p>
  <p>The  comparison tale can be told by any project member, whether it is a  manager or a subordinate. The audience can be any subset of the  project team.</p>
  <p><strong>WHY:</strong></p>
  <p>The  goal behind the telling of the comparison story may be either to  compare and criticize how things are in the current project, and how  they used to be better in the compared situation. The other  motivation could just be to appreciate how the situation in the  current project is better, or that progress is better than the other  situation. </p>
  <p><BR>
      <U><strong>Story Type : </strong></U></p>
  <p><em><U><strong>The  Utopian View</strong></U></em></p>
  <p><strong>Brief  Description:</strong></p>
  <p>The  Utopian Tale is a pattern where the story is told to describe  someone's vision of the ideal, with an intention to have the project  follow the vision. </p>
  <p><strong>HOW(Style):</strong></p>
  <p>The  utopian tale is told informally, usually at the beginning of an  endeavor by someone whose vision is supposed to be followed. The  message is subtle but normally less so than the Cautionary Tale  pattern.</p>
  <p><strong>WHO:</strong></p>
  <p>The  client, the manager or some major stakeholder may tell the Utopian  View story in hope that the audience is the relevant members of the  project who can implement the view. </p>
  <p><strong>WHY:</strong></p>
  <p>The  goal of telling the Utopian Tale is to describe the ideal situation,  either for the process to follow, the product to build, or just for  the working relationship. It is rarely expected that the utopian view  would be implemented in full, but it is expected that a lot of  direction and learning is imbibed from the story, to implement what  is feasible.</p>
  <p><strong>Cause:</strong></p>
  <p>The  leader/client may not believe that he/she is dictating how things are  done at all and may actually believe that he is letting the team make  their own decisions.</p>
  <p>The  leader may have a fixed and clear idea of their expectations of the  team and thus knows what he/she wants done.</p>
  <p>The  leader may feel like he/she does not have enough confidence in the  team's abilities to make their own decisions, thus prefers to dictate  how things are done while still hearing the team's views on the best  next step.</p>
  <p>The  leader may have been practicing this type of leading style for a long  time and now does not even realize that they are doing it. </p>
  <p>The  leader wants things done a certain way, but wants to also hear the  team's views to see if left on their own, would they also make the  same decisions without the leader's urging.</p>
  <p><strong>Effects:</strong></p>
  <p>The  team feels like they are making the decisions with guidance from the  leader.</p>
  <p>The  team may feel like the leader only asks for their opinion to test  whether they are on the right track, but actually is telling them  what to do.</p>
  <p>The  team may feel under pressure to answer in alignment with what the  leader expects, when asked what they intend to do next, like they are  being quizzed.</p>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p>Hank  explaining how things are best done, and then asking the team what  they intend to do next. If their views on the next step are different  from his, then leading them to align their views.</p>
  <p> Hank: You  folks can be really creative about it.... well anyway what will you  be doing</p>
  <p> Denise: Rip in  the code probably, do some of the skeletoning stuff, now we know what  we have to do.</p>
  <p> Hank:
    <!-- Hank first asks what the students are planning to do, but then goes on to tell them what he would want them to do. It could be a sign that Hank still wants to be able to dictate the course of what is done, but he wants the team to feel like they have a say in it as well. This could be a subtle form of encouragement. -->
    I would recommend a couple of things, since we just looked at  this Simulink stuff, you could play around with it while this is  still fresh in your minds and start going through the blocks and  start writing about things you dont think you need, and things you  think you need, maybe write a sentence each about the blocks. We  could meet next time and discuss it and
  <!-- It is good that Hank wants to be able to evaluate the team's understanding and progress and is probably paying more attention to the student team than perhaps was paid to S1 -->
    I could tell you whether you were close or not.  Or you could make a skeleton. It might be easier than directly making  the skeleton, If you want to make the skeleton, you could try that  but it might not be a super efficient use of your time. You could try  it if you want, I suppose, I mean the more background you have on  this the more help it will be.
  <!-- This could also be an indication that Hank wants the team to feel like they are also in control of what is happening, perhaps so they would be more involved. -->
    But I'll leave it up to you to decide.<BR>
  </p>
  <p><U><strong>Pattern: </strong></U></p>
  <p><em><U><strong>Spokesperson</strong></U></em></p>
  <p>The  more dependable member of the team (sub leader) decides to represent  the team in front of the client. This is more so when other members  of the team have not inspired enough confidence in their abilities  and better judgment yet.<BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>HOW(Style):</strong></p>
  <p>This  pattern can have both a formal and informal style. If there is an  explicit decision to have one person act as a team representative,  then the stye of communication becomes more formal, and may even be a  strategic pattern. When this is done implicitly, without any kind of  democratic decision-making, then the pattern is tactical.<BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>WHO:</strong></p>
  <p>The  spokesperson is a member of the team. Their responsibility is to  represent the team for outside parties, like the client or a manager.  The spokesperson should be regularly canvassing opinion, to ensure  what they are representing is the true sentiment of the team, and not  just their opinion</p>
  <p><strong>Cause: </strong> </p>
  <p>This  may happen for several reasons, </p>
  <p>one  because the sub leader knows that bad news would be better received  coming from the sub leader. Another reason is that the sub leader  believes, as may also be true, that they handle the communication  with the leader/client more tactfully. </p>
  <p>Another  reason is that the other team members may be more comfortable with  one person, the sub leader, managing their interaction with the  leader/client, thereby becoming a single point of contact. Some team  members may be shy and may not want to feel pressure to be called  upon for explanations. Sometimes the sub leader is actually the  person doing the lion's share of the work and feels like they would  know what they are talking about as opposed to the other team  members. </p>
  <p>Sometimes  the sub leader wants to ensure that the leader/client believes that  the sub leader is doing work and therefore has all the answers, out  of a simple need for attention.</p>
  <p><strong>Effect:</strong></p>
  <p>The  leader/client may start to believe that the sub leader is the only  reliable source of information on the team's progress.</p>
  <p>The  leader may not have any reason to have more faith in the other team  member's abilities, and may start to get frustrated.</p>
  <p>The  leader maybe happy that they only have to take updates from one  unofficial Point of Contact and finds the arrangement more  convenient.</p>
  <p><BR>
      <strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p>Denise  speaking on behalf of the team while updating progress. </p>
  <p> Hank:  You were going to put them together as S functions. You mentioned  that things hadn't gone as fast as you'd hoped. There could be two  reasons for that. I am not trying to pass the blame but it usually  comes down to two things, that it is a time on hand or you're stuck.
    <!-- Again, Hank is inquiring about the team's plan and progress, but now, he explicitly states that he knows they will make time for it, and he is offering help if they need technical assistance. -->
    If it is a time issue, then I know you'll find  time, but if you're stuck then I need to know.</p>
  <p> Denise:  I've been sick. I was ill last week, and definitely not fine on  Thursday and Friday.</p>
  <p> Hank:  So there are no big issues like understanding or functions not  working, virus or bugs in the code.</p>
  <p> Denise:  No it is completely me being sick.</p>
  <p>Hank:
    <!-- A recurring pattern where Bob is missing from meetings again, and Hank making sure that the team realizes that it is not going unnoticed. This has probably shaken his confidence a little bit, as he appears to be taking updates with a slightly more firm tone than the team had probably become accustomed to in the last few successful meetings. -->
    So we're waiting for Bob?</p>
  <p>Denise:  (updates on what she had tried to do the previous day)</p>
  <p>Hank:
    <!-- The way Hank is taking updates has significantly changed at this point, from asking how much progress was made up front, to casually asking if there was 'any action' -->
    So where are things at? Any action since the  last, I missed one right?</p>
  <p>Denise:  Yes, we've made some progress.</p>
  <p>Hank:  Did you folks have a meeting?</p>
  <p>Denise:
    <!-- There is a huge amount of confidence with which Denise updates Hank, and tells him how they 'pretty much decided everything' -->
    Yes we did and we have pretty much decided  everything, like everything that needs to be called and for  the code blocks the ones that are pretty much not needed.</p>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><U><strong>Pattern: </strong></U></p>
  <p><em><U><strong>Brainstorming</strong></U></em></p>
  <p><BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Brief  Description:</strong></p>
  <p>A  healthy exchange of ideas in an attempt to resolve a known problem or  to discover new problems. The team members, often along with the  leader attempt to analyze a problem and offer solution alternatives  to examine. When a consensus is reached on what the best next step  is, the meeting is considered successful.</p>
  <p><BR>
      <strong>Cause:</strong></p>
  <p>When a  single problem or list thereof starts to become a stumbling block to  progress of the team, a brainstorming session is usually called.</p>
  <p>Some  teams know from previous experience that ideas flow easily in a  brainstorming session and schedule them in as part of the team's  normal meetings.</p>
  <p>Sometimes,  just a catch-up or update session becomes an ad hoc brainstorming  session based on need and a sudden involvement of members of the  team.</p>
  <p><strong>Effect:</strong></p>
  <p>This  is a healthy means of allowing all team members and others to attempt  to resolve problems and share their ideas and feel like they are  contributing. </p>
  <p>It  also puts into practice the notion that the collective intelligence  of a group is higher than the sum of the individual.</p>
  <p>This  is also a means of actively engaging the team members into  discussion.</p>
  <p><BR>
      <strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p>Denise  and Bob talking about ways to cover and interpret the code.</p>
  <p> Denise:  (taking updates)
    <!-- At this point in the project, Denise is directly taking updates, clearly having completely emerged as the leader in the team. -->
    How far along are you at the code?</p>
  <p> Bob: I looked  at the stuff that you sent me. And need to change the numbering.</p>
  <p> Denise:  Changing parenthesis to brackets would work.</p>
  <p> (code  variables discussion between Justin and Denise)</p>
  <p> Denise: Did  you try a function declaration for dot?</p>
  <p> Justin: Yes, I  tried it and still doesn't work, I will have to rearrange the some  other functions that do the same thing in there.</p>
  <p>Denise  describes some problems with the code, regarding the damping mode  block. Hank suggests using one block to calculate the active  damping values and use that instead of the way the code was  previously structured. Or to use an S-function which also does the  same way. There is a healthy exchange of ideas in this meeting  between Denise and Hank. Hank shows the working of particular flags  being set in certain S-functions on his computer. And then leaves it  to the team to decide how they prefer doing it. Denise asks if Hank  knows where the logical breaks in the code are, because it is not  structured such that it is easy to determine that. Hank makes some  suggestions in ways to identify the breaks and other things which  might help the team structure the code. They discuss using different  data structures like arrays or structs to help manipulate the code  better. Denise says the documentation is not completely helpful in  explaining how to use structures and passing them. Hank says that  trying to use the structs might be taken as a challenge and could  keep things interesting.</p>
