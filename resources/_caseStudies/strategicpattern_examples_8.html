  <p><U><strong>Example of Strategic Pattern: </strong></U></p>
  <p><em><U><strong>Spokesperson</strong></U></em></p>
  <p>The  more dependable member of the team (sub leader) decides to represent  the team in front of the client. This is more so when other members  of the team have not inspired enough confidence in their abilities  and better judgment yet.<BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>HOW(Style):</strong></p>
  <p>This  pattern can have both a formal and informal style. If there is an  explicit decision to have one person act as a team representative,  then the stye of communication becomes more formal, and may even be a  strategic pattern. When this is done implicitly, without any kind of  democratic decision-making, then the pattern is tactical.<BR>
  </p>
  <p><strong>WHO:</strong></p>
  <p>The  spokesperson is a member of the team. Their responsibility is to  represent the team for outside parties, like the client or a manager.  The spokesperson should be regularly canvassing opinion, to ensure  what they are representing is the true sentiment of the team, and not  just their opinion</p>
  <p><strong>Cause: </strong> </p>
  <p>This  may happen for several reasons, </p>
  <p>one  because the sub leader knows that bad news would be better received  coming from the sub leader. Another reason is that the sub leader  believes, as may also be true, that they handle the communication  with the leader/client more tactfully. </p>
  <p>Another  reason is that the other team members may be more comfortable with  one person, the sub leader, managing their interaction with the  leader/client, thereby becoming a single point of contact. Some team  members may be shy and may not want to feel pressure to be called  upon for explanations. Sometimes the sub leader is actually the  person doing the lion's share of the work and feels like they would  know what they are talking about as opposed to the other team  members. </p>
  <p>Sometimes  the sub leader wants to ensure that the leader/client believes that  the sub leader is doing work and therefore has all the answers, out  of a simple need for attention.</p>
  <p><strong>Effect:</strong></p>
  <p>The  leader/client may start to believe that the sub leader is the only  reliable source of information on the team's progress.</p>
  <p>The  leader may not have any reason to have more faith in the other team  member's abilities, and may start to get frustrated.</p>
  <p>The  leader maybe happy that they only have to take updates from one  unofficial Point of Contact and finds the arrangement more  convenient.</p>
  <p><BR>
      <strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p>Denise  speaking on behalf of the team while updating progress. </p>
  <p> Hank:  You were going to put them together as S functions. You mentioned  that things hadn't gone as fast as you'd hoped. There could be two  reasons for that. I am not trying to pass the blame but it usually  comes down to two things, that it is a time on hand or you're stuck.
    <!-- Again, Hank is inquiring about the team's plan and progress, but now, he explicitly states that he knows they will make time for it, and he is offering help if they need technical assistance. -->
    If it is a time issue, then I know you'll find  time, but if you're stuck then I need to know.</p>
  <p> Denise:  I've been sick. I was ill last week, and definitely not fine on  Thursday and Friday.</p>
  <p> Hank:  So there are no big issues like understanding or functions not  working, virus or bugs in the code.</p>
  <p> Denise:  No it is completely me being sick.</p>
  <p>Hank:
    <!-- A recurring pattern where Bob is missing from meetings again, and Hank making sure that the team realizes that it is not going unnoticed. This has probably shaken his confidence a little bit, as he appears to be taking updates with a slightly more firm tone than the team had probably become accustomed to in the last few successful meetings. -->
    So we're waiting for Bob?</p>
  <p>Denise:  (updates on what she had tried to do the previous day)</p>
  <p>Hank:
    <!-- The way Hank is taking updates has significantly changed at this point, from asking how much progress was made up front, to casually asking if there was 'any action' -->
    So where are things at? Any action since the  last, I missed one right?</p>
  <p>Denise:  Yes, we've made some progress.</p>
  <p>Hank:  Did you folks have a meeting?</p>
  <p>Denise:
    <!-- There is a huge amount of confidence with which Denise updates Hank, and tells him how they 'pretty much decided everything' -->
    Yes we did and we have pretty much decided  everything, like everything that needs to be called and for  the code blocks the ones that are pretty much not needed.</p>
