      <p>From:  Denise</p>
      <p>To:  crane-cs-l@mtu.edu</p>
      <p>Crane  Team,</p>
      <p>We  have our weekly meeting with Hank today at 12.</p>
      <p>Attached  is some documentation regarding code decomposition that someone  recently did for Hank regarding outlining the code. He believes this  will be useful to compare with what we have. It appears to be mainly  about the main function, and how the inputs are taken in...</p>
      <p>See  you then,</p>

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>During  the meeting on the 15th&nbsp; Hank checks on the teams’  progress. He asks how they are dividing the tasks, which Denise  explains. He also shows appreciation for the flowchart Justin sent  out, as well as for Denise’s hand-drawn chart.</p>

	  <p>Hank:
          <!--  -->
        So we're waiting for Bob?</p>
      <p>Denise:  (updates on what she had tried to do the previous day)</p>
      <p>Hank:
          <!-- -->
        So where are things at? Any action since the  last, I missed one right?</p>
      <p>Denise:  Yes, we've made some progress.</p>
      <p>Hank:  Did you folks have a meeting?</p>
      <p>Denise:
          <!--  -->
        Yes we did and we have pretty much decided  everything, like everything that needs to be called and for  the code blocks the ones that are pretty much not needed.</p>
      <p>Hank:  Is this your chart?</p>
      <p>Denise:  Yes</p>
      <p>Hank:  It looks exactly like his.(another chart from a company that is a  navy contractor, to keep track of the code)</p>
      <p>Denise:  No, his chart is much nicer.</p>
      <p>Hank:  So have you folks started diviying it up?</p>
      <p>Denise:  This is where we need some help. So this is what happens in the  code(pointing at Denise's chart) </p>
      <p>[Denise  explains on her chart that she has color coded based on which locks  are her responsibility and how the chart dscribes the blocks ]</p>
      <p>Hank:  Can you show me some example within the code?
          <!--  -->
        This is great. Don't throw this out. Is this  hand-drawn?</p>
      <p>Denise:  Yes, I love the colors.</p>
      <p>[Denise  shows Hank some parts of code alongside what is present in the blocks  in her chart. And explains where she got stuck in the code regarding  inline code and function calls]</p>
      <p>Hank:  Can I see your simplified file?</p>
      <p>[Hank  asks Denise some questions about her chart and the code, and Denise  answers based on her understanding.]</p>
      <p>Hank:  You know what it would take is about an hour and a half to sit down  with the code and compare it with the blocks on the sheet. Let us set  that up, and
          <!-- -->
         we don't all have to be there but the more the  merrier. The goal of that session will be to trim this down  into the necessary functions and to organize the S functions. By the  end of that session, we will have that done. Now, have you folks  tried writing an S function yet?</p>
      <p>Bob:  Not really.</p>
      <p>Hank:  I would suggest that you try writing one before that session and it  will make a lot of sense once you write one. Try something simple,  like matrix multiplication. Have you tried and have there been  barriers in writing S functions?</p>
      <p>Denise:  No</p>
      <p>Justin:  Well, I have been wondering about the global parameters.</p>
      <p>Hank:  Yes, that is something which you can try and that will be helpful.</p>
      <p>Justin  describes his attempt at trying to run an S function and the problem  encountered.</p>
      <p>Hank:  Here is what I would do is I would just get an S function working,  and get a H file and stick some things in it.</p>
      <p>Denise:
          <!--  -->
        When are you available to meet for this.</p>
      <p>[The  team decides to meet the next week half and hour before and till  after their regular session]</p>
      <p>Hank:
          <!-- -->
        In the Matlab documentation they mention some  examples.</p>
      <p>Denise:  I have tried some of those.</p>
      <p>Hank:  And try to push the boundaries and write something of your own. So I  sent you a lot of examples right? I think I sent them on that  computer.</p>
      <p>[Hank  asks them about what they would have to submit to Dave for being  graded on it, and Bob says that they might have to do a report but  they would discuss it with Dave.]</p>

      </p>
      <p>[Crane  2\Crane 2 Drawings\Drawing3-15.pdf]</p>
         <!-- removed space -->
      <p>They  spend some time going over the code, and Matlab</p>
      <p>[Matlab-Code  3-15.mp3, 14 min.]</p>

      <p>
      Denise  describes some problems with the code, regarding the damping mode  block. Hank suggests using one block to calculate the active  damping values and use that instead of the way the code was  previously structured. Or to use an S-function which also does the  same way. There is a healthy exchange of ideas in this meeting  between Denise and Hank. Hank shows the working of particular flags  being set in certain S-functions on his computer. And then leaves it  to the team to decide how they prefer doing it. Denise asks if Hank  knows where the logical breaks in the code are, because it is not  structured such that it is easy to determine that. Hank makes some  suggestions in ways to identify the breaks and other things which  might help the team structure the code. They discuss using different  data structures like arrays or structs to help manipulate the code  better. Denise says the documentation is not completely helpful in  explaining how to use structures and passing them. Hank says that  trying to use the structs might be taken as a challenge and could  keep things interesting. They also discuss problems in  initialization.</p>
      <p><BR>
          <BR>
      </p>
      <p>And  spend some time trying to get some terms defined, especially  ‘deadman’</p>
      <p>[Terms  3-15.mp3, 4 min.]</p>

      <p>Denise  asks Hank some questions regarding the role of “deadman”. Hank  explains what deadman is, along with its relevance.
          <!---->
        Bob also asks some questions regarding  how matlab is using the flags in the code. Hank draws a picture to  accompany his explanation. </p>
      <p>Before  the meeting with Hank on the 22nd, Bob sends an example he  got from the platform team:</p>

      <p>From:  denise@mtu.edu</p>
      <p>To:  crane-cs-l@mtu.edu</p>

      <p>Howdy,</p>
      <p>attached  is the revised code for the control function as per our discussion  with Hank today. There are comment blocks at the begining/end of each  s-function chunk, except that part that initializes the variables for  the 3 computational sections, because that still has to be divided  into which S-functions need what.</p>
         
      <p>
        <!-- Denise takes charge and publishes a ''to-do” list for the whole team. -->
        To  do this week ~</p>
      <p>Bob:  weekly presentation; become MatLab expert</p>
      <p>Denise:  move the #defines to a .h file, work out some VeryLargeVector</p>
      <p>(VLV)  ideas for passing around global modifiable variables in MatLab</p>
      <p>Justin:  work on splitting up the un-assigned portion of the control function  into the 3 calculating s-functions.</p>

	    <p>Attached  is some documentation regarding code decomposition that someone  recently did for Hank regarding outlining the code. He believes this  will be useful to compare with what we have. It appears to be mainly  about the main function, and how the inputs are taken in...</p>
	    <p>See  you then,</p>
	    <p>--Denise</p>

	  <p>During  the meeting on the 15th&nbsp; Hank checks on the teams’  progress. He asks how they are dividing the tasks, which Denise  explains. He also shows appreciation for the flowchart Justin sent  out, as well as for Denise’s hand-drawn chart.</p>

          So we're       
	    <a class="tooltip">waiting <span class="classic">
	      <p>A recurring pattern where Bob is missing from meetings again, and Hank making sure that the team realizes that it is not going unnoticed. This has probably shaken his confidence a little bit, as he appears to be taking updates with a slightly more firm tone than the team had probably become accustomed to in the last few successful meetings.</p>
	      </span></a>for Bob?
	    </p>
        <p>Denise:  (updates on what she had tried to do the previous day)</p>
	    <p>Hank:
	      <!-- -->
	      So where are things at?       
	    <a class="tooltip">Any action<span class="classic">
	      <p>The way Hank is taking updates has significantly changed at this point, from asking how much progress was made up front, to casually asking if there was 'any action' </p>
	      </span></a> since the  last, I missed one right?
	    </p>
        <p>Denise:  Yes, we've made some progress.</p>
	    <p>Hank:  Did you folks have a meeting?</p>
	    <p>Denise:
	      <!--  -->
        <a class="tooltip"> Yes we did<span class="classic">
          <p>There is a huge amount of confidence with which Denise updates Hank, and tells him how they 'pretty much decided everything'</p>
          </span></a> and we have pretty much decided  everything, like everything that needs to be called and for  the code blocks the ones that are pretty much not needed.
	    </p>
        <p>Hank:  Is this your chart?</p>
	    <p>Denise:  Yes</p>
	    <p>Hank:  It looks exactly like his.(another chart from a company that is a  navy contractor, to keep track of the code)</p>
	    <p>Denise:  No, his chart is much nicer.</p>
	    <p>Hank:  So have you folks started diviying it up?</p>
	    <p>Denise:  This is where we need some help. So this is what happens in the  code(pointing at Denise's chart) </p>
	    <p>[Denise  explains on her chart that she has color coded based on which locks  are her responsibility and how the chart dscribes the blocks ]</p>
	    <p>Hank:  Can you show me some example within the code?
	      <!--  -->
        <a class="tooltip"> This is great. <span class="classic">
          <p>Even though the meeting started off on a slightly sour note due to Bob's tardiness, but Denise saves the day by impressing Hank with her code block chart, demonstrating the depth of her understanding of the code and in some ways proving the worth of having the team involved.</p>
          </span></a>Don't throw this out. Is this  hand-drawn?
	    </p>
        <p>Denise:  Yes, I love the colors.</p>
	    <p>[Denise  shows Hank some parts of code alongside what is present in the blocks  in her chart. And explains where she got stuck in the code regarding  inline code and function calls]</p>
	    <p>Hank:  Can I see your simplified file?</p>
	    <p>[Hank  asks Denise some questions about her chart and the code, and Denise  answers based on her understanding.]</p>
	    <p>Hank:  You know what it would take is about an hour and a half to sit down  with the code and compare it with the blocks on the sheet. Let us set  that up, and
	      <!-- -->
        <a class="tooltip"> we don't all <span class="classic">
          <p>Hank again makes a small reference to issues with attendance, perhaps also subtly indicating that having Denise around should be enough, as even he can see now that she really knows what she is talking about. </p>
          </span></a>have to be there but the more the  merrier. The goal of that session will be to trim this down  into the necessary functions and to organize the S functions. By the  end of that session, we will have that done. Now, have you folks  tried writing an S function yet?
	    </p>
        <p>Bob:  Not really.</p>
	    <p>Hank:  I would suggest that you try writing one before that session and it  will make a lot of sense once you write one. Try something simple,  like matrix multiplication. Have you tried and have there been  barriers in writing S functions?</p>
	    <p>Denise:  No</p>
	    <p>Justin:  Well, I have been wondering about the global parameters.</p>
	    <p>Hank:  Yes, that is something which you can try and that will be helpful.</p>
	    <p>Justin  describes his attempt at trying to run an S function and the problem  encountered.</p>
	    <p>Hank:  Here is what I would do is I would just get an S function working,  and get a H file and stick some things in it.</p>
	    <p>Denise:

	      When are you

	      <p>Denise in some small measure taking charge of a meeting with Hank, and driving decisions about meetings to be taken.</p>
	      </span></a> to meet for this.

        <p>[The  team decides to meet the next week half and hour before and till  after their regular session]</p>
	    <p>Hank:
	      <!-- -->
	      In the Matlab documentation they       
	    <a class="tooltip">mention some  examples.<span class="classic">
	      <p> Hank again tries to assess if the team have been doing what they were told or expected to and Denise lets him know that they had tried some examples, to assure him that they had not been slacking off. At this point, Hank can clearly see that Denise has been doing a significant share of the work and is in charge.</p>
	      </span></a>
	    </p>
        <p>Denise:  I have tried some of those.</p>
	    <p>Hank:  And try to push the boundaries and write something of your own. So I  sent you a lot of examples right? I think I sent them on that  computer.</p>
	    <p>[Hank  asks them about what they would have to submit to Dave for being  graded on it, and Bob says that they might have to do a report but  they would discuss it with Dave.]</p>

      <p>They  spend some time going over the code, and Matlab</p>

      <p>       
      <a class="tooltip">Denise  describes <span class="classic">
      <p>We can see Denise and Hank discussing almost as equals here. This shows how much the dynamics of the team, at least Denise have changed with Hank.</p>
      </span></a>some problems with the code, regarding the damping mode  block. Hank suggests using one block to calculate the active  damping values and use that instead of the way the code was  previously structured. Or to use an S-function which also does the  same way. There is a healthy exchange of ideas in this meeting  between Denise and Hank. Hank shows the working of particular flags  being set in certain S-functions on his computer. And then leaves it  to the team to decide how they prefer doing it. Denise asks if Hank  knows where the logical breaks in the code are, because it is not  structured such that it is easy to determine that. Hank makes some  suggestions in ways to identify the breaks and other things which  might help the team structure the code. They discuss using different  data structures like arrays or structs to help manipulate the code  better. Denise says the documentation is not completely helpful in  explaining how to use structures and passing them. Hank says that  trying to use the structs might be taken as a challenge and could  keep things interesting. They also discuss problems in  initialization.

      <p>And  spend some time trying to get some terms defined, especially  ‘deadman’</p>
      <p>[Terms  3-15.mp3, 4 min.]</p>
      <p>Denise  asks Hank some questions regarding the role of “deadman”. Hank  explains what deadman is, along with its relevance.

      <a class="tooltip"> Bob also asks <span class="classic">
      <p> Here we can see Bob, perhaps for one of the first times, asking very structured, specific questions of technical significance. Hank would start to see that the team is working as a whole, because so far, he had seen a lot of input from Denise, but not as much from the rest of the members of the team. </p>
      </span></a>some questions regarding  how matlab is using the flags in the code. Hank draws a picture to  accompany his explanation.

        <p>From:  denise@mtu.edu</p>
        <p>To:  crane-cs-l@mtu.edu</p>
        <p>Howdy,</p>
        <p>attached  is the revised code for the control function as per our discussion  with Hank today. There are comment blocks at the begining/end of each  s-function chunk, except that part that initializes the variables for  the 3 computational sections, because that still has to be divided  into which S-functions need what.</p>
        <p>
          <!-- Denise takes charge and publishes a ''to-do” list for the whole team. -->
          To  do this week ~</p>
        <p>Bob:  weekly presentation; become MatLab expert</p>
        <p>Denise:  move the #defines to a .h file, work out some VeryLargeVector</p>
        <p>(VLV)  ideas for passing around global modifiable variables in MatLab</p>
        <p>Justin:  work on splitting up the un-assigned portion of the control function  into the 3 calculating s-functions.</p>
