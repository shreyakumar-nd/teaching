  <p><U><strong>Example of Strategic Pattern: </strong></U></p>
  <p><U><strong>Pattern:</strong></U></p>
  <p><em><strong>Stakeholder team meetings</strong></em></p>
  <p><strong>Brief  Description:</strong></p>
  <p>A  stakeholder meeting is usually a formal meeting of all or most  important and interested stakeholders. It can be called for several  different reasons </p>
  <p><strong>Types  of stakeholder meetings:</strong></p>
  <UL>
    <LI> Demo/Prototype  	presentation – This type of meeting involves the stakeholders so  	that they can assess and review design or progress. </LI>
    <LI> Information  	Solicitation - This type of meeting may involve the stakeholders for  	different reasons. Either because the project team needs to solicit  	information, like requirements from the stakeholders, or because the  	stakeholders want to be involved in information solicitation from an  	important third party.</LI>
    <LI> Decision  	making/Project Planning – This type of meeting involves the  	stakeholders because any major decisions on the project may affect  	the stakeholder's interests.</LI>
    <LI> Brainstorming  	session – On rare occasions, stakeholders may be involved in  	brainstorming sessions to solve problems or resolve burning issues,  	which may affect the project delivery.</LI>
    <BR>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Brief  Description : </strong> </p>
  <p>In  projects where the stakeholders wish to maintain tight control of the  progress or to define scope actively, frequent stakeholder meetings  may be called for taking major decisions, specially those that would  affect multiple teams/parties. This could also be the pattern close  to product delivery or launch when important decisions need to be  taken.</p>
  <p><strong>WHAT</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> Team  	member and stakeholder meetings are held frequently to be able to  	discuss and review the project scope regularly and make decisions.  	All affected and interested stakeholders are encouraged to  	participate. </LI>
    <LI> This  	type of communication pattern may be centered around artifacts like  	project scope or progress plan or projected returns plan. Usually  	these artifacts are accompanied by a meeting agenda, which might  	include reviewing the project plan, etc.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Context  :</strong></p>
  <p><strong>WHERE</strong></p>
  <UL>
    <LI> This  	form of communication is applicable where there is active  	stakeholder involvement and willingness to meet and make decisions. </LI>
    <LI> It  	is almost necessary where the scope of the project is left flexibly  	defined or when decisions need to be confirmed or reviewed close to  	launch and more so where the project type is such that market trends  	might affect launch enormously. </LI>
    <LI> Frequent  	stakeholder meetings can be considered useful during the delivery  	phase of large projects as well, when certain critical time line  	based decisions may need to be taken, or final consent may be needed  	to take market delivery based decisions. </LI>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>WHO</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> Stakeholders  	and either all team members or at least a representatives from each  	team are typical participants. </LI>
    <LI> Often,  	small teams may have no representation in stakeholder meetings if  	they don't have any say in the decision making process, depending on  	the model of organization</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Style  :</strong></p>
  <p><strong>HOW</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> The  	style of communication is very formal. Meetings with stakeholder  	involvement tend to be agenda driven. As stakeholders are usually  	people in upper management, they tend to also be people who are  	usually busy, therefore having a prepared agenda is the norm in  	those meetings.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Goals  : </strong> </p>
  <p><strong>WHY</strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> The  	goals of deciding to have stakeholder meetings frequently have to do  	with closely observing progress and team abilities and consider  	delivery time lines and prioritize requirements, in the initial  	phases of the project. </LI>
    <LI> This  	allows for good change management, specially where market factors  	affect delivery and active stakeholder involvement may be considered  	beneficial.</LI>
    <LI> If  	in the beginning, the number of stakeholders is large or if the  	exact nature and scope of the work is not clear, and project members  	know that changes in cope can be expected, then to rigidly define  	the scope and work off of it is not considered prudent, and it is  	accepted that the scope of the project will be flexibly defined,  	with room to accommodate new requirements or even completely  	different work related to the same project, later.</LI>
    <LI> Sometimes  	this is done so that the client can evaluate the team's performance  	on part of the work, and if suitably impressed, later decide to  	assign more work to them. The decision to meet frequently is to  	affect identifying changes in scope quickly. Also taking notes  	during meetings and sharing that with others may be decided based on  	availability of involved stakeholders.</LI>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Benefits  Analysis : </strong> </p>
  <UL>
    <LI> Flexible  	scope management can be tricky. As good time management is dependent  	on knowing beforehand the amount and complexity of the work to be  	undertaken. When the scope of the work is left not clearly defined,  	then to factor how much time it should take to do the amount of work  	becomes difficult. Also, if the scope is not clear, it may become  	difficult to focus and prioritize work.</li>
    <LI> Considering  	the volatile nature of requirements, specially in the software  	engineering field, it is usually beneficial to keep scope flexibly  	defined, but being careful of still being able to prioritize, even  	in the absence of all the requirements. </li>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Risks  :</strong></p>
  <UL>
    <LI> Having  	meetings more frequently does not guarantee more decisions being  	made. Sometimes a communication pattern is noticed where meetings  	are not very effective. A lot of discussion takes place along with  	exchange of ideas, but no real decisions get made and the next  	meeting follows the same pattern where ideas are discussed, but no  	tangible action is taken.</li>
    <LI> As  	the stakeholders will tend to come from different teams or  	management positions and may have different goals to meet  	individually using the project, it may sometimes be difficult to  	reach consensus on decisions, specially when a compromise or more  	has to be made.</li>
  </UL>
  <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
  <p>Seabase  I where in the end of October, the team realized that they have to do  design in MATLAB in addition to porting the code from C. Scope change  or change in expectations.</p>
