	  <p><strong>Sunday  6th February 2005 – Saturday, 19th February  2005</strong></p>
	  <p><strong>Story</strong></p>
	  <p>Before  the second meeting with Hank, on February 8th, the CS team  holds a short “pre-meeting”. Denise poses some questions she has,  based on her work with the code and Matlab. The main meeting opens  with Denise’s questions, often posed by Bob.</p>
	  <p><strong>[Matlab  Questions 2-8.mp3, 20 min.]</strong></p>
	  <p> All CS team  members ask some questions of Hank and Hank explains several aspects  of the working of Matlab, regarding parameters and header files and  writing code in C to use in Matlab in different ways. Hank does ask  for an informal update on what was discussed in the previous meeting  to assess any progress made in segregating functions into two bins-  trash and useful.</p>
	  <p> What this  meeting probably showed Hank was that the team had looked into what  was discussed in the last meeting and were asking specific questions  about concepts integral to both porting the code and interpreting it.  This probably helped increase Hank's level of confidence in the  team's abilities. </p>
	  <p>The tone of  the meeting appears to have changed from a pedagogical theme, like in  the last meeting, to more conversational interactive mode, where Hank  is still explaining things and answering questions but the CS team is  actively participating with either questions or ideas. The team also  appears to be more comfortable with Hank in this meeting.</p>
	  <p>Hank  sketches a drawing to show the different inputs, how they feed into  the control, and output to the motors on the crane:</p>
	  <p>[Crane  2\Crane 2 Drawings\Client Drawing2-8.pdf]</p>
	  <p>During  the meeting Denise asks about “initial values”. They feel these  should be provided by one of the ME teams, and Bob is tasked to  contact them:</p>
	  <p>[Initial  Values 2-8.mp3, 13 min]</p>
	  <p> To answer  Denise's questions, Hank explains the concepts of boom angle, swing  angle, ship motion, crane speed, etc. He suggests that the input  parameters be examined to see which variables mean what corresponding  real world values. He suggests that the team speak to some folks from  the ME teams to ask how they intend to implement these parameters. He  also suggests different ways to test how the measurements of some of  these parameters are taken, like using a joystick and how to  differentiate measured values with intended calculated results of the  same variables. He also explains the significance of a rotation  matrix, and its use in determining the orientation of bodies.</p>
	  <p>
	    <!--  -->
	    Finally,  the CS team negotiates responsibilities—who will do what—with  Hank. Justin takes the “top-down overview”, Bob will contact the  ME team, but suggests they not meet the next week.</p>
	  <p>[Setting  Responsibilities 2-8.mp3, 5 min.]</p>
	  <p>Hank says that  if the team is able to test their C function capabilities and take a  stab at Inverse Kinematics, then 
	      <!--  -->
	    they  can say that they are well on their way to understanding how it all  works.</p>
	  <p> The team  agrees to skip the next week's meeting because of Denise and the  other team members having exams due. Bob says that they will spend  that time in trying to get the skeleton together. Bob also takes the  responsibility of it.</p>
	  <p>
        <!--  -->
	    Hank  suggests  that the team consider dividing up the work amongst the team  members so that different parts of the work can be done  simultaneously.</p>
	  <p>Separately,  the team decide to meet multiple times during the week, to try to  figure out what the blocks do, specially main and control with  respect to S functions.
	      <!--  -->
	   Denise suggests  to Bob her idea of what they  should be doing. Bob and Justin agree with what Denise is suggesting.</p>
	  <p>As  part of their CS Senior Design class, the team must present their  progress to Dave at bi-weekly meetings. You can see how their  progress was transformed into that presentation by viewing their  presentation:</p>
