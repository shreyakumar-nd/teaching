      <p>Subject:  Re: No meeting this week</p>
      <p>From:  Denise</p>
      <p>To:  Hank </p>
      <p>Cc:  crane-cs-l@mtu.edu</p>
      <p>Hank,</p>
      <p>We  are continuing code decomposition and design of the MatLab model this  week. We met Sunday evening to discuss how to implement the new PCS  code, including deciding which functions we felt were no longer  necessary. We also cleared up some design ideas about MatLab and Bob  gave us his report from the meeting he had with the platform team on  Thursday. Sounds like the platform team is going to be behind  schedule, which may impact our real-world testing, and they also do  not have any better idea of the ranges of inputs that we will be  taking in in our program.</p>
      <p>This
          <!--  -->
        leads to some questions about the code in the  main function, since</p>
      <p>that  code not only takes in the serial data about the current movement and  crane state, it also does some calculations on it in functions like</p>
      <p>EstimateShipMotion,  Estimate_Slope, and FilterShipMotion. Will the data we are taking in  going to be the same values that this old program took in, so we will  need to do the same calculations? Or will we be getting data that is  already estimated, filtered, etc?</p>
      <p>At  the end of the while loop in the main function there is a call to</p>
      <p>data_log,  which writes the current state and operations to a log on</p>
      <p>separate  machine. Are we keeping that in?</p>
      <p>We  have also generated some questions about implementation in MatLab,  such as in all of the simulations we have looked at so far we give a  specified run time length, how will the new program continue  executing as long as the user's wish it to?</p>
      <p>The  team is meeting on Thursday to do a similar re-design of CONTROL1, so  I am sure we will have many more questions for you after that.</p>
      <p>We  will see you for the next meeting on March 15,</p>
      <p>--Denise </p>

      <p>Prior  to their regular meeting on Thursday, Denise sends out a reminder:</p>
      <div class="email">
	  <p><strong>Date:  Wed, 2 Mar 2005 20:16:31 -0500 (EST)</strong></p>
      <p>Subject:  Crane Meeting Reminder</p>
      <p>From:  Denise</p>
      <p>To:  &quot;Crane Team&quot; &lt;crane-cs-l@mtu.edu&gt;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Just  a reminder to crane team members we are meeting Thursday, 11 am, in  Rehki 114 to do some more code decomposition. And make the powerpoint  if I dont get around to it tonight :)</p>
      <p>--Denise</p>
	  </div>
      <p>During the meeting, they wrestle with the existing  code, including trying to determine what “deadman” does and what  initial values they will have as input:</p>
      <p>[Code  Decomp 3-3.mp3, 11min.]</p>
      <p>[Denise  explains how she went about trying to make sense of the code, by  categorizing ways in which parameters were used and passed. Also that  she discovered that some parameters are not used at all. The biggest  problem is the switch statement and the team discuss what options  they have. Bob and Justin make suggestions about how the switch case  statements can be implemented and how parameters can be used within  the inverse kinematics block. They then discuss “deadman” and  hypothesize what its physical relevance could be based on where it is  declared, defined an d used.
          <!-- -->
        They then discuss some of the .h functions and try to determine the  significance of some of them.]</p>
      <p>and  how that raises more Matlab issues[Matlab Issues 3-3.mp3, 6min.]</p>
      <p>They  also try to resolve some design issues, again discussing the input  values and trying to define some terms</p>
      <p>[Design  Issues 3-3.mp3, 13min.]</p>
	  
	  <div class="transcript">
      <p>[We  can see that the discussion is mainly led by Denise based on her  understanding of the code. She also informally takes updates from the  rest of the team.]</p>
      <p> Denise: If we  took out the rider block stuff and the input shape block, that should  be the place to start.
          <!--  -->
        Have you done any work on that thing this week Bob?</p>
      <p> Bob: Not  really.</p>
      <p> Denise: I was  …..</p>
      <p> [Denise  checking the list of S functions to see whether they have been dealt  with in the team]</p>
      <p> Bob: Why are  there so many? Before, we had like 11 and now there are 25. Why do we  need a crane sensor? Wont that be determined by the ship motion. </p>
      <p> Denise: A lot  of these functions seem the same.</p>
      <p> Bob:
          <!--  -->
        The crane team never sends anything out,  I am on their mailing list and they never send anything out. The six  degrees guys send out emails like 4 times a day.</p>
      <p> Denise: The  six degrees are the platform guys?</p>
      <p> Bob: yeah, but  nothing from the crane guys. Something like, I have no idea how the  crane is built. I dont know whether the crane will have a platform  underneath it like hydraulics which keep it balanced, or whether the  crane moves with the ship and the arm controls the motion</p>
      <p> Denise: Yeah,  yeah, yeah, I want to know if we are supposed to mimic the platform  or the ship motion. I don't know if we control the platform or we  control the frame. That is a pretty big question. Do you know the  answer to that?</p>
      <p> Bob: No.</p>
      <p> Denise: But  you know what I am asking, right?</p>
      <p> Bob: Yeah I  know what you mean.</p>
      <p> Denise:
          <!--  -->
        I kind of wish I had been here last semester.</p>
      <p> Bob:
          <!--  -->
        We did well, but I was surprised, because we  did not accomplish anything.</p>
      <p> Justin: Like a  lot of values will change.</p>
      <p> Denise: Yes, a  lot of the values are things like distance of arm between crane and  platform. If they are designing a new crane, we need the new values.  We cannot test the design against the wrong crane or just any crane.</p>
      <p> Justin:  {mumbles}</p>
      <p> Denise: What  do all the static input variables </p>
      <p> Justin: We are  supposed to be regularly updating our risk document right?</p>
      <p> Denise(smiling):
          <!--  -->
         A good risk would be crane team does not finish  crane, platform team does not finish platform. We also need to  create a timeline document.
  <!--  -->
        Bob, if you want to look at that.</p>
      <p> Bob: how are  there six coordinates on this? The operator has... oh wait, there are  two joysticks, but what do those terms mean.</p>
      <p> Denise: the  operator manages the ships and the crane is supposed to … well then  operator... the current state and the desired state.</p>
      <p> Bob: Crane  config is what is going on. We fix the crane thing, the operator  moves the crane, and we try to balance the motion He is moving at  this speed, or swinging as much due to the motion, so we have to  balance the motion.</p>
      <p> Justin: But I  don’t understand why there are 6 still.</p>
      <p> Bob: Well  there is that material but it does not give me all these answers.</p>
      <p> Denise: Lets  hope our crane looks like that one. But he hands it to you and you do  not check whether it has what you need. </p>
      <p> Bob: Where do  the 6 values come from.</p>
      <p> Denise: Well  there is up and down on the pulley</p>
      <p> Justin: But  that should be like one.</p>
      <p> Denise: well  pulley up pulley down, right and left...</p>
      <p> Bob: Well  there is also roll pitch and motion</p>
      <p> Denise: What  is roll and pitch.. And are they gps coordinates? It seems lieke  there are too many coordinates going. There is the calculation on the  global, and then the local and then the globals and then local again.</p>
      <p> Bob: I think  it means initially, there is dh and dl, hoist and lower it says  initially, and then the ones without the i's are the current.</p>
      <p> Justin: Maybe  it uses the initial to find out the current.</p>
      <p> Denise: But  the i-variables are not used again in the control function. Why not  just have one variable though, it seems like one variable. Maybe it  is used in some sort of loop, but I don’t think there is any loop  in he control function. Oh wait there it is, it IS used again. </p>
      <p> Bob: But those  are ds not ls</p>
      <p> Denise: Oh  yeah, I forgot there are two sets. </p>
      <p> (more  discussion on variables and their potential uses)</p>
      <p> Bob: Didn’t  he mention something about a tagline for moving that line.</p>
      <p> Denise: But I  thought hoist was up and down.</p>
      <p> Bob:  Look(gesticulates) here, this is the pulley, hoist is for the pulley  motion, and the tagline is this other motion.</p>
      <p> Denise: ohh...  small victory.
          <!--  -->

      <p>This  is an excerpt from the Design issues transcript, present before,  where they are discussing where the 20 plus values are coming from  and again hypothesizing what the different values signify. This is a  discussion where all three team members actively contribute and try  to brainstorm so that their understanding of the code is clear.</p>
     
	  <p>You  can also hear them discuss how to update their risk document, </p>
      <p>[Risk  Doc 3-3.mp3, 9min.] </p>
      <p>[This  is also an excerpt which is present before as part of the transcript  for the Design issues, where the team remembers that they have to  update their risk document and they realize that their results are  significantly dependent on the other ME teams, as they will not be  able to test any of their software's functionality if the simulators  are not working]</p>

      <p>Cc:  crane-cs-l@mtu.edu</p>
      <p>Hank,</p>
      <p>We  are continuing code decomposition and design of the MatLab model this  week. We met Sunday evening to discuss how to implement the new PCS  code, including deciding which functions we felt were no longer  necessary. We also cleared up some design ideas about MatLab and Bob  gave us his report from the meeting he had with the platform team on  Thursday. Sounds like the platform team is going to be behind  schedule, which may impact our real-world testing, and they also do  not have any better idea of the ranges of inputs that we will be  taking in in our program.</p>
      <p>This
          <!--  -->
        <a class="tooltip">leads <span class="classic"><p>Another instance where Denise demonstrates how well structured and specific questions should be asked.</p></span></a>to some questions about the code in the  main function, since</p>
      <p>that  code not only takes in the serial data about the current movement and  crane state, it also does some calculations on it in functions like</p>
      <p>EstimateShipMotion,  Estimate_Slope, and FilterShipMotion. Will the data we are taking in  going to be the same values that this old program took in, so we will  need to do the same calculations? Or will we be getting data that is  already estimated, filtered, etc?</p>
      <p>At  the end of the while loop in the main function there is a call to</p>
      <p>data_log,  which writes the current state and operations to a log on</p>
      <p>separate  machine. Are we keeping that in?</p>
      <p>We  have also generated some questions about implementation in MatLab,  such as in all of the simulations we have looked at so far we give a  specified run time length, how will the new program continue  executing as long as the user's wish it to?</p>
      <p>The  team is meeting on Thursday to do a similar re-design of CONTROL1, so  I am sure we will have many more questions for you after that.</p>
      <p>We  will see you for the next meeting on March 15,</p>

      <p>Prior  to their regular meeting on Thursday, Denise sends out a reminder:</p>
      <div class="email">
	  <p><strong>Date:  Wed, 2 Mar 2005 20:16:31 -0500 (EST)</strong></p>
      <p>Subject:  Crane Meeting Reminder</p>
      <p>From:  Denise</p>
      <p>To:  &quot;Crane Team&quot; &lt;crane-cs-l@mtu.edu&gt;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Just  a reminder to crane team members we are meeting Thursday, 11 am, in  Rehki 114 to do some more code decomposition. And make the powerpoint  if I dont get around to it tonight :)</p>
      <p>--Denise</p>
	  </div>
      <p>During the meeting, they wrestle with the existing  code, including trying to determine what “deadman” does and what  initial values they will have as input:</p>
      <p>[Code  Decomp 3-3.mp3, 11min.]</p>
      <p>[Denise  explains how she went about trying to make sense of the code, by  categorizing ways in which parameters were used and passed. Also that  she discovered that some parameters are not used at all. The biggest  problem is the switch statement and the team discuss what options  they have. Bob and Justin make suggestions about how the switch case  statements can be implemented and how parameters can be used within  the inverse kinematics block. They then discuss “deadman” and  hypothesize what its physical relevance could be based on where it is  declared, defined an d used.
          <!-- -->
        <a class="tooltip">They then discuss<span class="classic"><p> This is clearly a team meeting where Denise is established as the strongest technical member of team.</p></span></a> some of the .h functions and try to determine the  significance of some of them.]</p>
      <p>and  how that raises more Matlab issues[Matlab Issues 3-3.mp3, 6min.]</p>
      <p>They  also try to resolve some design issues, again discussing the input  values and trying to define some terms</p>
      <p>[Design  Issues 3-3.mp3, 13min.]</p>
	  
	  <div class="transcript">
      <p>[We  can see that the discussion is mainly led by Denise based on her  understanding of the code. She also informally takes updates from the  rest of the team.]</p>
      <p> Denise: If we  took out the rider block stuff and the input shape block, that should  be the place to start.
          <!--  -->
       <a class="tooltip"> Have you done<span class="classic"><p>Denise is clearly in charge of the team now, and one can see her taking updates, although with a friendly tone of voice, but she is making sure that they live up to Hank's expectations as a team, specially considering the fact that she has had to answer to Hank for the team's shortcomings on occasions before.</p></span></a> any work on that thing this week Bob?</p>
      <p> Bob: Not  really.</p>
      <p> Denise: I was  …..</p>
      <p> [Denise  checking the list of S functions to see whether they have been dealt  with in the team]</p>
      <p> Bob: Why are  there so many? Before, we had like 11 and now there are 25. Why do we  need a crane sensor? Wont that be determined by the ship motion. </p>
      <p> Denise: A lot  of these functions seem the same.</p>
      <p> Bob:
          <!--  -->
        The <a class="tooltip"> crane team<span class="classic"><p>Bob highlights problems with being able to coordinate with the other ME teams, due to their lack of response. This turns out to be a significant issue later.</p></span></a> never sends anything out,  I am on their mailing list and they never send anything out. The six  degrees guys send out emails like 4 times a day.</p>
      <p> Denise: The  six degrees are the platform guys?</p>
      <p> Bob: yeah, but  nothing from the crane guys. Something like, I have no idea how the  crane is built. I dont know whether the crane will have a platform  underneath it like hydraulics which keep it balanced, or whether the  crane moves with the ship and the arm controls the motion</p>
      <p> Denise: Yeah,  yeah, yeah, I want to know if we are supposed to mimic the platform  or the ship motion. I don't know if we control the platform or we  control the frame. That is a pretty big question. Do you know the  answer to that?</p>
      <p> Bob: No.</p>
      <p> Denise: But  you know what I am asking, right?</p>
      <p> Bob: Yeah I  know what you mean.</p>
      <p> Denise:
          <!--  -->
        I kind of <a class="tooltip">wish I had been here<span class="classic"><p>Denise demonstrates her confidence her abilities to have done a better job in the previous semester. This is a far more confident stance than the first meeting with Hank, where the team and specially Denise did not seem too sure.</p></span></a> last semester.</p>
      <p> Bob:
          <!--  -->
        We did well, but <a class="tooltip">I was surprised, <span class="classic"><p>Bob attempts to defend their efforts in the previous semester in the face of Denise's remark.</p></span></a>because we  did not accomplish anything.</p>
      <p> Justin: Like a  lot of values will change.</p>
      <p> Denise: Yes, a  lot of the values are things like distance of arm between crane and  platform. If they are designing a new crane, we need the new values.  We cannot test the design against the wrong crane or just any crane.</p>
      <p> Justin:  {mumbles}</p>
      <p> Denise: What  do all the static input variables </p>
      <p> Justin: We are  supposed to be regularly updating our risk document right?</p>
      <p> Denise(smiling):
          <!--  -->
         <a class="tooltip">A good risk<span class="classic"><p>Denise expresses her doubts about the other teams keeping up with the schedule.</p></span></a> would be crane team does not finish  crane, platform team does not finish platform. We also need to  create a timeline document.
  <!--  -->
        <a class="tooltip">Bob, if you want <span class="classic"><p>Denise feels comfortable assigning tasks and responsibilities within the team, as she has assumed the implicit role of leader.</p></span></a>to look at that.</p>
      <p> Bob: how are  there six coordinates on this? The operator has... oh wait, there are  two joysticks, but what do those terms mean.</p>
      <p> Denise: the  operator manages the ships and the crane is supposed to … well then  operator... the current state and the desired state.</p>
      <p> Bob: Crane  config is what is going on. We fix the crane thing, the operator  moves the crane, and we try to balance the motion He is moving at  this speed, or swinging as much due to the motion, so we have to  balance the motion.</p>
      <p> Justin: But I  don’t understand why there are 6 still.</p>
      <p> Bob: Well  there is that material but it does not give me all these answers.</p>
      <p> Denise: Lets  hope our crane looks like that one. But he hands it to you and you do  not check whether it has what you need. </p>
      <p> Bob: Where do  the 6 values come from.</p>
      <p> Denise: Well  there is up and down on the pulley</p>
      <p> Justin: But  that should be like one.</p>
      <p> Denise: well  pulley up pulley down, right and left...</p>
      <p> Bob: Well  there is also roll pitch and motion</p>
      <p> Denise: What  is roll and pitch.. And are they gps coordinates? It seems lieke  there are too many coordinates going. There is the calculation on the  global, and then the local and then the globals and then local again.</p>
      <p> Bob: I think  it means initially, there is dh and dl, hoist and lower it says  initially, and then the ones without the i's are the current.</p>
      <p> Justin: Maybe  it uses the initial to find out the current.</p>
      <p> Denise: But  the i-variables are not used again in the control function. Why not  just have one variable though, it seems like one variable. Maybe it  is used in some sort of loop, but I don’t think there is any loop  in he control function. Oh wait there it is, it IS used again. </p>
      <p> Bob: But those  are ds not ls</p>
      <p> Denise: Oh  yeah, I forgot there are two sets. </p>
      <p> (more  discussion on variables and their potential uses)</p>
      <p> Bob: Didn’t  he mention something about a tagline for moving that line.</p>
      <p> Denise: But I  thought hoist was up and down.</p>
      <p> Bob:  Look(gesticulates) here, this is the pulley, hoist is for the pulley  motion, and the tagline is this other motion.</p>
      <p> Denise: ohh...  small victory.
          <!--  -->
        <a class="tooltip">Write this stuff down <span class="classic"><p>Even though it is said with a jovial tone, Denise is now giving direct instructions to her teammates, again asserting her place as leader, but very subtly.</p></span></a>so you dont forget it.</p>
      <p>and  realize that they are not communicating well with Hank, and have to  “go back” to him for answers</p>

      <p>[Communication  3-3.mp3, 9min.]</p>
	 
      <p>This  is an excerpt from the Design issues transcript, present before,  where they are discussing where the 20 plus values are coming from  and again hypothesizing what the different values signify. This is a  discussion where all three team members actively contribute and try  to brainstorm so that their understanding of the code is clear.</p>
     
	  <p>You  can also hear them discuss how to update their risk document, </p>
      <p>[Risk  Doc 3-3.mp3, 9min.] </p>
      <p>[This  is also an excerpt which is present before as part of the transcript  for the Design issues, where the team remembers that they have to  update their risk document and they realize that their results are  significantly dependent on the other ME teams, as they will not be  able to test any of their software's functionality if the simulators  are not working]</p>
