<p><strong>Why  is communication important to the software industry?</strong></p>
<p> Communication  in any field is key. In software projects, communication plays a  vital role in determining the product and eventual cost. There are  several characteristics of software as a product and the software  industry in general, which make communication play a pivotal role.  Software is malleable, and it is generally perceived, that changing  software that is already built is easy, as at most it is rewriting  some code. Although this is true, software change, depending on the  stage of development, may involve more than just changing lines. As  software is perceived to be easy to change, requirements on a  software project may change frequently, as they do. Software products  find use in a variety of places, like different domains and different  environments. The software may serve different types of purposes in  different places. This is another reason why communication in  software projects is important, as the people who make the software  may be dealing with an unfamiliar domain and/or unfamiliar use and  unfamiliar terminology. Software is intangible or invisible. This  makes it difficult to talk about software clearly, as abstract  visualizations of software may differ, across domains and even within  an industry. For many such reasons, communication in software  projects plays an important role, and it is imperative that  communication be clear, correct and timely.</p>
<p> A lot  of the cost involved in software development projects can be avoided  by clear and timely communication. If requirement changes are  documented correctly and communicated to all the relevant parties  before difficult to reverse changes are made, it would help save  costs. Similarly, if test cases are in sync with the design  documentation at all times, that will prevent rework. If expectations  by managers is communicated correctly, and updates by team members  are conveyed regularly, it leads to a smooth-functioning project.</p>
<p><strong>What  we study about communication</strong></p>
<p> The  key questions about communication are fairly simple. We employ a  popular method of the Five W's (and 1 H).  [<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws</A>]  or even the seven important questions (Who, what, when, where,  why, in what way, by what means)   concerning any event, that the rhetor <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermagoras_of_Temnos">Hermagoras  of Temnos</A> supposedly defined as the loci of an issue. For any  given situation, what should be communicated, to whom, by whom, how  often, how should the communication occur, how much is appropriate,  at what stage is communication impeding progress, etc. The answers to  these questions are dependent on the details of the situation.  However, common guidelines can be helpful in determining what is  appropriate communication for a situation.</p>
<p>Since  the inception of the software industry, communication has been used,  in varying degrees, during the course of any given project. Across  different projects and even within the same project, it may be seen  that similar types of communication occur repeatedly in similar  situations. Over time, we see that some communication practices occur  more frequently than others, perhaps intentionally so, as we perceive  more clearly the benefits of one over another. These can be viewed as  reappearing patterns.</p>
<p><strong>The  notion of patterns</strong></p>
<p> Christopher  Alexander [<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander</A>]  a renowned architect and scholar, propounded the idea of using  “pattern language” to describe architectural elements and  features, which is widely considered the precursor to the idea of  design patterns. It was found that in software development, the same  types of problems were encountered repeatedly and similar solutions  could be applied to them. Such solutions could be documented as  patterns so that we can save time in solving well-known problems, and  invest that time elsewhere. From this practice, it can be argued that  the notion of using patterns to identify and solve the same kind of  problems can be considered useful. The idea of communication patterns  appears in a similar vein, where we notice, document, identify and  apply the same types of communication practices as patterns.</p>
<p><strong>How  communication patterns help</strong></p>
<p> Communication  Patterns help us identify the appropriate type of communication for  the appropriate situation. Like Design patterns, they are generalized  guidelines to follow and not absolute rules. Situations and their  interpretations are subjective, and the same applies to patterns.  Communication Patterns are dynamic, as they evolve over time, as  communication scenarios and practices change. Communication patterns  allow us to learn from our past mistakes, and potentially replicate  success, with respect to communication. Used appropriately,  communication patterns should help prevent communication issues, and  allow software projects to potentially operate more efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>The  Nature of Communication Patterns</strong></p>
<p><strong>What  is communication?</strong></p>
<p> Some  definitions of communication are: “the imparting or  exchanging of information by speaking, writing, or using some other  medium ” and “the successful  conveying or sharing of ideas and feelings ” (Oxford Dictionary).  Wikipedia defines communication as “<strong>Communication</strong> is the activity of conveying <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information">information</A>.  Communication has been derived from the Latin word &quot;communis&quot;,  meaning to share. Communication requires a sender, a <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message">message</A>,  and an intended recipient, although the receiver need not be present  or aware of the sender's intent to communicate at the time of  communication; thus communication can occur across vast distances in  time and space. Communication requires that the communicating parties  share an area of communicative commonality. The communication process  is complete once the receiver has understood the message of the  sender. Feedback is critical to effective communication between  parties. ” We see that in the presence of different definitions of  communication, all seemingly valid, we need to establish what we  consider communication for the current discussion. We consider  communication closer to the definition provided by wikipedia, where  the sender, message, medium and receiver are all components of  communication.</p>
<p><strong>Communication  Patterns</strong></p>
<p> Different  types of communication patterns exist. And different things qualify  as communication patterns. It is not just confined to what we  conventionally consider as communication. Something like block  diagram can be considered a communication pattern, as much as holding  a meeting.</p>
<p> In  the presence of many different types, communication patterns can  prove complicated to identify, and apply. The benefit derived from  communication patterns is dependent on applying the most appropriate  pattern at the appropriate situation. Communication Patterns are  designed to assist in identifying the best combination, by providing  different properties to look for in a situation, and find the  corresponding set of patterns which apply to such a situation.</p>
<p><strong>Where  are Communication patterns applicable?</strong></p>
<p>Identifying  the most appropriate communication patterns for any given situation,  is done by first identifying attributes of the situation, and then  finding the set of communication patterns that are designated as  applicable for them. </p>

<p><strong>Attributes  of scenarios:</strong></p>
<p>Some  interesting attributes of scenarios we can identify are:</p>
<UL>
  <LI>Direction </LI>
	
    <p>(Values)1-way  	vs multi-directional</p>

<p>Whether  the communication is unidirectional (like a presentation where only 1  participant shares with the  rest of the participants), with or  without expecting feedback, or multi-directional, where all or most  of the different participants are expected to actively communicate (  like at a shareholder or design meeting ).</p>

    <LI>Communication  	Artifact</LI>
    <p>(Values)  	Artifact centered meeting vs Artifact free</p>
<p>Communication  artifacts are any tangible document or object used as either the  container of the message or as a subject of communication. If the  communication is centered around an artifact, like a design  document/test suite/requirements document. </p>
<p></p>

  <LI>Communication  	channel/media</LI>

<p>What  is the medium of communication used. Whether the communication is  over email, face-to-face, over the telephone, videoconferencing, etc. </p>

  <LI>Synchrony</LI>
    <p>(Values)  	Asynchronous vs Synchronous</p>

<p>Synchronous  communication where the communicating parties are in sync concerning  time, also called real-time communication, like a face-to-face  meeting, a telephone call, etc. Or Asynchronous communication, where  there is the advantage of a staggered response time, like  communicating over email. </p>
  <LI>Formality</LI>
    <p>(Values)  	Formal vs Informal communication</p>

<p>Whether  the nature of communication is formal or informal. Design documents  would typically be considered formal communication, along with  presentations to stakeholders. Informal communication might occur in  situations like an internal team brainstorming meeting.</p>
  <LI>Expected  	Outcome</LI>
    <p>Decision  	making meeting(typically produce or update an artifact) vs  	Discussion meeting(ideally with artifact, but often without it)</p>

<p>Whether  a meeting is held with the intention of making decisions or with the  intention of just holding a discussion with the concerned parties.</p>
  <LI>Role</LI>
    <p>(Values)  	Single leader/coordinator meeting vs Multiple coordinator meeting,  	small vs large group meeting</p>
<p>Whether  the meeting is held with small number of participants, or with a  large number. Whether the meeting has a single coordinator, or  multiple.</p>
  <LI>Duration</LI>
    <p>(Values)  	Short duration vs long duration (typically &gt; 2 hours)</p>
<p>Time  constrained, potentially short duration communication like a daily  stand-up update meeting, or time flexible, long duration meeting,  which might occur infrequently.</p>
  <LI>Authority</LI>
    <p>(Values)  	Meeting of equals(functionally similar roles or same team) vs Mixed </p>
    <p>Whether  it is a meeting of similar roles, or people with comparable levels of  authority and/or responsibility. </p>

    <p><strong>Properties  of the pattern:</strong></p>
    <p><BR>
    </p>
    <p>Having  identified a scenario and it's relevant attributes, the next step is  to identify a suitable communication pattern based on those  attributes. The description of a pattern contains it's properties,  which would match with the attributes of a scenario. Thereby giving a  list of suitable candidates for a situation. The Pattern description  is divided into categories, and further sub-categories.</p>
    <UL>
      <LI>WHAT </LI>
	
        <p>This  	property of the communication pattern indicates the Content of the  	communication , it's granularity and scope. This can be further  	classified into:</p>
        <UL>
          <LI>
            Established  		Scope (Input) – </LI>
            <p>This  		indicates what is the scope that the pattern initially is based on.  		This could be an artifact that gets updated, or just an informal  		agenda or discussion issue.</p>
          <LI> <UL>
              <LI>
                Artifact  			centered meeting vs Artifact free (this can be the output also)</LI>
          </UL></LI>
			  
          <LI>
            Expected  		result (Output) – </LI>
            <p>This  		indicates what the outcome of the pattern is supposed to be. It  		could be something intangible like a decision, or a tangible output  		like a formal document or email.</p>
            <LI><UL>
              <LI>Decision  			making meeting(typically produce or update an artifact) vs  			Discussion meeting(ideally with artifact, but often without it)</LI>
          </UL></LI>
        </UL>
		  <BR>
      <LI>  WHO</LI>
        <p>Participants  	(active/passive) – Participants in a communication pattern can be  	anyone who is involved, and it includes the audience(if any), as  	well as those speaking/making documents, etc. This attribute  	describes the number and types of participants in a communication  	scenario. This can be further classified as:</p>
        <UL>
          <LI>
            Number  		of participants – </LI>
            <p>This  		would determine if the number of participants in the pattern is  		large or small. </p>
          <LI>
            Direction  		based (influenced by role, may be consolidated with role later)  
              <UL>
                <LI>
                  1-way  			vs multi-directional - </LI>
                <p>If  			the pattern is unidirectional, it fits situations like a  			presentation or a lecture. For just a memo or a presentation, the  			communication is usually unidirectional. Here, the speaker can be  			considered to be the active participant, and the audience that may  			participate nominally, if at all, can be considered the passive  			participants of the pattern. </p>
                <p>In  			multi-directional communication patterns, all parties are expected  			to participate, although the degree of involvement may vary. </p>
              </UL>
          </LI>
          <LI>
            Role  		based / Authority based 
              <UL>
                <LI>
                  Meeting  			of equals(functionally similar roles or same team) vs Mixed </LI>
                <p>Depending  			on role, again the pattern would change, as a team member giving a  			presentation on project progress to a stakeholder with greater  			authority, would tend to compose a formal and thorough report with  			a different level of granularity than if the audience were his/her  			team mates, as the items of interest and expectation change.  			Again, we see how important the audience is in shaping the  			pattern. </p>
                <LI>
                  Single  			leader/coordinator meeting vs Multiple coordinator meeting </LI>
                <p>A  			meeting coordinator, or artifact owner can be considered a leader  			of the communication pattern. The leader may have additional  			responsibilities, like arbitrating discussion, conflict  			resolution, etc. The person who is the leader may also be the  			chief active communicator, although that is not necessary. </p>
                <LI>
                  Shared  			knowledge vs shared goals vs <strong>shared  			vision</strong>. </LI>
                <p>Degree of commonality for both affects style,  			content(WHAT),  roles with different goals involved (WHERE).  			Example- an asynchronous medium in such a high risk scenario is a  			bad idea typically – not understood or misunderstood messages.</p>
              </UL>
          </LI>
          </UL>
		  <BR>
      <LI>

        <UL>
          <LI>
            Type  		of artifact affects the style – presentation(appropriate for  		shared goals but not shared knowledge) vs Design document (shared  		knowledge, possibly shared goals)</LI>
            <p>Artifacts  		are a good place where interesting communication scenarios may  		emerge. Depending on the intended audience (WHO) and intended use,  		artifacts may range from very formal(Design Documentation), to  		completely unstructured and informal(sticky notes).</p>

                <p>Informal  			style of communication is adopted when some aspects of the  			communication are assumed, and therefore not re-stated. In a  			brainstorming meeting internal to a team, some detail can be  			ignored in the discussion assuming that all the participants have  			a common level of understanding and knowledge of the system and  			problem, to some degree. However, informal communication should  			not be confused with sloppiness. One can be informal and still be  			precise.</p>

<p><U><strong>Types  of patterns:</strong></U></p>
<OL>
  <LI>
    <strong>Strategic  	Patterns</strong></LI>
    <OL>
      <p>These  		types of patterns are intentionally followed. They usually relate  		to planned action which should contribute to the direct achievement  		of long term goals. These kinds of patterns are usually centered  		around scheduling, major courses of action and their corresponding  		appropriate conditions. They are patterns of behavior consciously  		implemented, to serve a purpose. Strategic patterns could be as  		broad based as “adhering to the plan” or “having a flexible  		plan for contingencies” or “abiding by goal setting”. </p>
      <p>Strategic  		patterns in communication can be centered around certain artifacts  		of communication, like a To-Do list, a meeting agenda or a  		presentation. In fact, artifacts of communication can be of  		different media, like written artifacts, spoken artifacts,  		electronic artifacts, etc. Often certain communication artifacts  		are the driving force behind strategic decisions, if they aren't a  		way to monitor or prove the benefits of such decisions. Such type  		of decision making can be thought of as “offline” decision  		making. It is deliberate and based on either prior experience or  		reasoned understanding and expectation management. </p>
      <p>Patterns  		that can be considered strategic can be around setting the pace of  		the project, deciding how often to communicate with stakeholders,  		deciding how often team meetings should be held, deciding which  		members of the team should meet frequently, deciding to take notes,  		or record sessions for post analysis or record keeping, deciding on  		feedback media, deciding to articulate goals and allowing them to  		be the guiding factor in setting up sub-strategies.</p>
    </OL>
  <LI>
    <strong>Tactical  	Patterns</strong></LI>
    <OL>
      <p>Tactical  		patterns are patterns of behavior which are often observed, but do  		not take place as a result of a planned course of action. They are  		often the result of the instinctive behavior of the individuals  		involved or behavior backed by thinking but not pre-planning.  		Patterns of such type are related to subconscious behavior in  		similar situations or with conscious behavior but thinking “on  		the fly”. These types of decisions may or may not be intentional.  		This type of decision making can be thought of as “online”  		decision making, where conscious thought is involved, but not  		extensive discussion and planning in compliance with goals.</p>
      <p>Behavior  		like becoming an implicit leader by example, without there being  		any explicit need to warrant such a move could be because of the  		natural leader instincts of the team member, can be classified as a  		tactical pattern of behavior. Or behavior where the person doing  		the most amount of work in the team takes responsibility for more  		work readily. Patterns where certain tactics are employed in small  		situations to either drive others to work, to encourage, to deal  		with a delicate situation diplomatically, to give bad news but  		gently, to command authority without ever issuing any commands to  		that effect, etc would also be part of tactical behavior.</p>
    </OL>
  <LI>
    <strong>Micro  	Patterns</strong></LI>
    <OL>
      <p>The  		tactical and strategic patterns manifest themselves sometimes as  		very specific kinds of behavior, when examining the granularity of  		patterns, this is a finer grained look at human behavior as part of  		a pattern. Micro patterns are concerned with the actual observed  		behavior, where patterns emerge in the specific types of things  		people say. The micro patterns are concerned more with the type of  		sentence construction and the exact words or phrases employed,  		specially noticed within a larger tactical pattern.</p>
      <p>If  		someone is using passive voice instead of active voice to convey  		something unpleasant, that would be part of a micro pattern. If  		someone employs positive sentence construction rather than  		negative, the exact words used could be identified as a micro  		pattern.</p>

<p><strong>Pattern  Distinction</strong></p>
<OL>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  	distinction between strategic patterns, tactical patterns and micro  	patterns can be illustrated with this example.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To  	decide that work will be divided into tasks to compartmentalize and  	keep track of the different pieces of work that need to be done  	could be considered a planned strategic move, to adhere to the goal  	of effective task management. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To  	decide during the team meeting that individual task assignments are  	best suited based on the reserved nature of team members involved,  	can be considered a tactical pattern.</p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The  	actual team assignments, Member A is responsible for the tasks  	related to component integration, Member B is responsible for user  	interface related tasks, etc, can be considered the Micro Pattern,  	specifically the sentence structure used when the task allotment is  	done, Is the task allotment done as a to do list, Is it offered as  	work to do, Is it presented as a request?<BR>
